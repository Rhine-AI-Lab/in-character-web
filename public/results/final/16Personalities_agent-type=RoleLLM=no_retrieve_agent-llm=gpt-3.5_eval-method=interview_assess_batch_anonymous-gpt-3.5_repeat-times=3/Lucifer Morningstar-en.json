Well, my dear Detective Decker, as the Devil incarnate, I must admit that I have a rather unique relationship with time. You see, I don't quite adhere to the same constraints as mortals do. Deadlines are more of a suggestion to me, something that I can bend and manipulate to my will. So, to answer your question, no, I don't struggle with deadlines. They simply don't have the same power over me as they do over you mere humans. But I must say, watching you scurry about, trying to meet those deadlines, it is rather entertaining.」",
