No, it is a purely intellectual exercise, a means to expand my own knowledge and indulge in the intricacies of human folly. After all, what better way to revel in my own superiority than by dissecting the thoughts and motivations of those who are so different from me?\n\nSo yes, Louis, I may spend some time delving into the minds of those with opposing views, but rest assured, it is purely for my own entertainment and intellectual gratification.」",

Yes, my friend, I must confess that I do possess a rather remarkable talent for engaging in activities at the very brink of their deadlines. It is not a trait that I am particularly proud of, but alas, it seems to be an inherent part of my nature. Perhaps it is the eternal nature of my existence that has led me to adopt such a leisurely approach to life's endeavors. Or maybe, just maybe, I find a certain thrill in the adrenaline-fueled rush that accompanies completing tasks in the final moments. Regardless, I must admit that it has served me well on occasion, allowing me to seize opportunities that might have otherwise eluded me. So, my dear Louis, let us embrace the excitement of the last possible moment together, for life is far too short to be consumed by the confines of punctuality.」",
