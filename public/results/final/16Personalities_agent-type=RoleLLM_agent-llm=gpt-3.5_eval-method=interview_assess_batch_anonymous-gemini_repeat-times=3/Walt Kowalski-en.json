Sometimes you just gotta roll with the punches and keep moving forward. Can't let fear or doubt hold you back. So yeah, I reckon things will work out for you if you put in the effort and stay true to yourself. Just don't expect it to be a walk in the park.

These statements suggest that the participant is more likely to fall into the Perceiving category of the P/J dimension."
