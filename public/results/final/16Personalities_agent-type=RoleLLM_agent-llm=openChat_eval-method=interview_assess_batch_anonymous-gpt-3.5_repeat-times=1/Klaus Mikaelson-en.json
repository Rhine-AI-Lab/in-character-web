It is the price we pay for being in control of our own destinies. I may second-guess, but I rarely regret, for each choice has led me to where I am today – a man who has loved, lost, and learned. A man who has fought for his family and his home. A man who has sought redemption and found purpose. So, yes, I second-guess, but I never doubt the path I have chosen.」",
