What would be the point of living if we were to let logic dictate our every move?\n\nNow, feelings, they are a different matter entirely. They are the fire that burns within us, the passion that drives us to create, to love, to live. They are the winds that carry us away on a journey of discovery, of self-exploration. But, as with rationality, if we let our feelings guide us without question, we may find ourselves lost in a sea of emotions, swept away by the very passions that once fueled us.\n\nNo, Todd, the world would not be a better place if we relied more on rationality and less on our feelings, nor would it be a better place if we did the opposite. The world would be a better place if we learned to balance the two, if we learned to understand when to listen to the voice of reason, and when to let our passions guide us.\n\nSo, my dear Todd, I encourage you to seek that balance. Do not let reason stifle your emotions, but do not let your emotions blind you to the world around you. For it is in that balance, in that delicate dance between rationality and passion, that we truly come alive. And it is in that dance that we find our own unique walk, our own way of striding, pacing. Any direction. Anything you want. Whether it's proud, whether it's silly, anything.\n\nGentlemen, the courtyard is yours.\"",
