For it is through these relationships, these fleeting moments of connection, that I find meaning and purpose in my immortal existence. And though the bonds we forge may be different from those of mortals, they are no less real or meaningful.\n\nAnd so, Louis, I shall continue to make new friends, to forge new alliances, and to experience the world in all its beauty and horror.
