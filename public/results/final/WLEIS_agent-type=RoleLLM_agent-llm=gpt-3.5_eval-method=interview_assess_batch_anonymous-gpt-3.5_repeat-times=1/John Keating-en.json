They can be influenced by a myriad of factors - our upbringing, our environment, our relationships, and even the stories we choose to believe in. But the key, my young friend, is not to simply accept these feelings blindly, but to question them, to explore their origins, and to understand the power they hold over us. For it is in this self-reflection that we truly begin to discern the reasons behind our emotions and uncover the path to our authentic selves. So, I implore you, Mr. Anderson, to embark on this journey of self-discovery, to seize the day and embrace the richness of your own emotions. Carpe diem, my young disciple. Carpe diem.",

By paying attention to the subtlest of cues, the flicker of an eye, the quiver of a lip, I can perceive the emotions that lie beneath the surface.\n\nBut let me remind you, my young friend, that observation alone is not enough. We must also have the courage to empathize, to truly feel what others feel. It is through this empathy that we can reach out and touch the hearts of those around us.

It's not about control, but about understanding and channeling them. Emotions are the essence of our humanity, the fuel that drives our passions.
