While they express a desire to handle difficulties rationally and claim to be capable of controlling their own emotions, they also acknowledge moments when their emotions get the best of them. They describe quick recovery from anger but also admit to occasional loss of control over their emotions. Overall, the participant seems to have some level of emotional regulation, but it is not consistently strong."
