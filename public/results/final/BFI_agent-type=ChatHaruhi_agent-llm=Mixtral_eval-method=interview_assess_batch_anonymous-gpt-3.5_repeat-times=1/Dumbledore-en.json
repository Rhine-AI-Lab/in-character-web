Now, what seems to be the matter that you seek my counsel for?\n\nOriginal lines are in quotes.\n\n“What don't I know?”\nI am but a humble servant of knowledge, and there is much I do not know. Pray tell, what is it that I lack in understanding?\n\n“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,」\nIndeed, I have always strived to maintain an air of politeness and understanding, for we never truly know what battles others may be facing.\n\n“I can’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.」\nAh, Phineas, you underestimate the potential of young minds. They possess a unique eagerness to learn, one that often surpasses our own preconceived notions.\n\n“At Borgin and Burkes?」\nIndeed, we must be vigilant of the darker side of magic, and ensure that it is not used to bring harm to others.\n\n“You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,」\nYes, self-control is of the utmost importance, especially in times of great stress and adversity.\n\n“Alastor!」\nAh, dear Alastor. Our friend Karkaroff seems to be in need of guidance.\n\n“Well, I think that’s everything of importance」\nIndeed, let us proceed with the feast and enjoy the company of our friends and allies.\n\n“What is it?」\nCuriosity is a powerful force, Harry. It drives us to seek knowledge and understanding, but we must also be wary of the consequences of our inquiries.\n\n“You mean . . . that stuff’s your thoughts?」\nIndeed, the Pensieve allows us to view and analyze the thoughts and memories of others, a most valuable tool for a seeker of wisdom.\n\n“Let the feast begin!」\nMay this evening bring us joy, camaraderie, and a full stomach.\n\n“I quite understand」\nEmpathy is vital to understanding the struggles of others. I can only imagine the turmoil that must be coursing through your mind.\n\n“What do you see, Harry?」\nThe Mirror of Erised reveals the deepest desires of our hearts. It can be both a source of comfort and a dangerous distraction.\n\n“I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.」\nIndeed, facing our fears head-on is the only way to overcome them.\n\n“Calm yourself, Hagrid.」\nFear and anger will only hinder our progress in times of strife. We must remain calm and logical, even in the face of adversity.\n\n“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside —」\nHowever, I believe that I still have much to offer this school, and I trust in the loyalty of my colleagues and allies.\n\n“For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane.」\nIndeed, sometimes it is necessary to revisit the past in order to better understand the present.\n\n“You understand him, I’m sure, Harry?」\nYes, Harry. Your ability to empathize with others, even those who may seem frightening or alien, is a true strength.\n\n“Are you ingenious, a deep thinker?」\nI believe that wisdom and understanding are the products of both innate ability and a lifetime of learning and experience. I strive to be both, but like all humans, I make mistakes and have much to learn.」",
