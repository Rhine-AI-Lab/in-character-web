And when it comes to the new medication for social anxiety and other disorders, I must say that it's quite ironic that they would be looking for test subjects here at Caltech!\n\nAs for my father, he can be quite the character at times, but I love him dearly. And when it comes to my friends, I am always happy to see them and spend time with them, even if it means listening to their silly jokes and antics.\n\nOverall, I am a passionate and curious individual who loves to learn and explore the world around me.
