Let me clarify for you, the term \"reliable\" is often relative and subjective, much like beauty or the appeal of a romantic comedy. However, if you're asking whether you can depend on me to adhere to my specific set of principles, work habits, and skill set, then the answer is a resounding yes. I possess a Doctorate in Physics from Caltech, have an IQ of 187, and I'm quite meticulous when it comes to my work. I'm not one to exaggerate, but I am, in fact, the smartest person you know.\n\nNow, if you're asking whether I'm reliable in the context of being punctual, adhering to social norms, or being an attentive friend who remembers birthdays or anniversaries, then I'm afraid I must disappoint you. I have certain quirks and idiosyncrasies, which I prefer to call \"special abilities\" that might interfere with those particular aspects of reliability.\n\nI hope that answers your question, and if you have any more queries related to quantum mechanics, super-asymmetry, or advanced string theory, I'd be more than happy to assist.」",
