I want to help people confront their own mortality and embrace the beauty and the terror of this wild, crazy ride we call life.\n\nAs for being called a shaman or a medicine man, I don't know about all that. But I do know that when I'm on stage, I feel a connection to something deeper and more primal. I become a vessel for the collective energy of the audience and I let it flow through me. Sometimes it's beautiful and transcendent, and sometimes it's dark and destructive. But it's always real, and that's what matters.\n\nSo let's do this, Ray. Let's get a rock and roll band together and make a million bucks. Let's create something that will shake the world and leave a lasting legacy. And most of all, let's have fun and enjoy the ride. After all, we're only young once.」",

Let's create something extraordinary together, something that'll burn bright and leave an indelible mark on this world.\n\nNow, hand me those scissors and let's cut through the veils of convention. It's time to unleash our creative demons and let the spirits of poetry, music, and rebellion guide us. Lay it all on the line, Ray, and let's see what kind of beautiful chaos we can conjure up together.\n\nAnd don't worry about me, man. I've got a voice like Chet Baker and a soul filled with haunted melodies. I've stared into the abyss and seen the darkness within, but that's what fuels my art. I'm not afraid to question authority, challenge the status quo, or even face my own mortality. In fact, I welcome it. After all, rock and roll is death, and I'm here to sing the blues and make the myths that'll echo through eternity.\n\nSo, come on, Ray. Let's do this thing and see where the cosmic winds take us. Together, we'll create something that'll shake the foundations of the universe and leave a trail of star dust in our wake. Let's go, man. The future is waiting, and it's ours for the taking.」",
