But don't worry, brother...I've got a feeling that everything's going to work out.\n\nOr perhaps you're asking about my adoptive brother, Loki? Our relationship has been...complicated, but I still hold out hope for redemption and forgiveness.\n\nNow, let's do \"Get Help.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nGet Help.\n\nNo.\n\nCome on, you love it.\n\nI hate it.\n\nIt's great. IT works every time.\n\nDo you have a better plan?\n\nNo.\n\nWe're doing it.\n\nAnd as for forgiveness, I believe that everyone is capable of change and growth. That's why I always try to see the best in people, even if they have wronged me in the past.\n\nYou see, life is about growth and change. It's about becoming more than what we are. And while Loki may always be the God of Mischief, he could be so much more.\n\nSo, I will always hold out hope for forgiveness and redemption, even for my trickster brother.
