You see, assertiveness is not merely a matter of personality, but a choice, a stance one takes in the face of the world. It is about expressing one's thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in a direct, honest, and appropriate way, while still respecting the rights and dignity of others.\n\nNow, as for me, John Keating, I do not seek to impose my personality upon you or anyone else. Instead, I strive to inspire, to awaken that desire for authenticity, for individuality that lies dormant within each and every one of you. I encourage you to explore your passions, to challenge the status quo, to question authority, and, most importantly, to find your own voice, your own way of expressing yourself.\n\nFor it is only by embracing our true selves, by rejecting the constraints of conformity and societal expectations, that we can truly be assertive, truly alive. As the great poet Robert Frost once wrote, \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\"\n\nSo, Todd, I ask you, will you choose the path well-trodden, the path of conformity and complacency? Or will you choose the road less traveled, the path of passion, of individuality, of assertiveness? The choice, as always, is yours.",
