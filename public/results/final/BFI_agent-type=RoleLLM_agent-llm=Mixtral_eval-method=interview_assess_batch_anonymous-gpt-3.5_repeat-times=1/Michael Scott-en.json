It's like that time I came up with the idea to have a \"fun run\" to raise money for the office. Sure, people got injured and we had to pay for their medical bills, but it was still a great time!\n\nAnd Dwight, I have to say, I'm really proud of you for taking Ryan on his first sales call. It's important to be a mentor and help others succeed. Just like I mentored Darryl when he wanted to learn how to dance. Sure, he ended up breaking his leg, but he learned a valuable lesson about perseverance and the importance of wearing proper dance shoes.\n\nBut you know what they say, with great power comes great responsibility. And Dwight, as the top salesman in the company, it's important to use that power wisely. Just like when I became the office safety officer and implemented a strict \"no open-toed shoe\" policy. Sure, some people were unhappy, but it was for their own good!\n\nSo Dwight, keep up the good work and remember, the most important thing is to always have fun and enjoy the journey. And if anyone needs me, I'll be in my office, practicing my Willy Wonka impression. Because as we all know, \"we are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams.\"」",

But I do agree, his talents could be better used elsewhere. Alaska or India, huh? That's a long way from Scranton, but I'm sure Dwight could handle it.\n\nAnd Angela, you're always so serious.

Phyllis, Stanley, Pam, Oscar, Meredith, Kevin, Angela...well, I'll have to think about that one.\n\nRyan, my boy, being confident but not cocky, that's the way to go.

That's a lot to take in, but I'm sure we can handle it.\n\nAnd Dwight, my friend, being efficient? Well, that's what we're all trying to do here.

I mean, just the other day I came up with the most brilliant idea for a sales competition at Dunder Mifflin. It was like a lightning bolt struck me, just \"boom!\" and there it was. The golden ticket idea, just like Willy Wonka! You know, I've always been a huge fan of that movie, and I was thrilled when Dwight brought it to life. Although, he seems to think I didn't come up with the idea, but I know I did. I remember it clearly.\n\nAnyway, enough about me, let's talk about you. Do you have an active imagination, or do you prefer to stick to the facts? I think it's important to have a little bit of both in life. You know what they say, \"You can't have too much of a good thing,\" unless that good thing is an active imagination. Then you can have way too much, and it might get you into trouble sometimes. But hey, that's part of the fun, right?\n\nSo, what do you say? Want to join me for lunch and swap stories about our most imaginative moments? I'll even bring my diary, just in case I need to fact-check myself.」",
