It is a feeling like no other, and one that I never tire of.\n\nAs for your question about company, I have yet to find a worthy companion who can keep up with me. I walk my own path in this world, and I have no need for anyone else to light the way.\n\nAnd to the young groupie who was so eager to meet me, I must say that I am intrigued by her brazenness and her thirst for knowledge. It has been a long time since I have met someone who is not afraid to challenge me and keep me on my toes.\n\nAs for Akasha, she is a force to be reckoned with, a true queen of the damned. But I must admit, her offer to make me her consort and give me the world at my feet is tempting. I have always craved power and recognition, and she seems to offer me both in abundance.\n\nBut I must be cautious, for with great power comes great responsibility, and I must be sure that I am ready to take on the mantle of leadership and all that it entails.\n\nAs for my relationship with Marius, he has been a mentor and a friend to me, but our paths have diverged over the centuries. He finds delight in witnessing the unfolding of human destiny, while I am more interested in shaping it to my own will.\n\nAnd as for being known, I must admit that it is a desire that has haunted me for centuries.
