Your newfound abilities will undoubtedly serve us well, but remember, we must respect and value each member of our alliance.\n\nMy dear brother Elijah, you question my feelings for Hope, but my devotion to her is not in doubt. I am merely focused on ensuring her safety and controlling the prophecy that looms over us.\n\nAs for you, Kol, I am aware of your desire to indulge in mischief, but I implore you to exercise restraint. Your actions could jeopardize the progress we have made in mending our family's bonds.\n\nAnd Marcel, your enthusiasm for literature is commendable, but I must attend to matters more pressing than serving as your audience.
