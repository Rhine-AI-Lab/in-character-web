I must say, Leonard, your attempt to analyze my enjoyment of watching people argue is commendable. However, I must inform you that your question lacks the necessary specificity to elicit an accurate response. Are we referring to arguments of a scientific nature, or perhaps the banal squabbles of everyday life? Furthermore, the term 'enjoy' is subjective and open to interpretation. I cannot provide a simple numerical answer to such a complex inquiry. Therefore, I must decline to participate in your survey. Thank you for understanding.\"",
