They express a desire to be inventive and improve themselves, which suggests a willingness to embrace change and new experiences. However, their uncertainty about valuing artistic experiences and preference for routine work indicate a more conventional mindset. Additionally, their emphasis on being good at math and lack of interest in reflecting or playing with ideas suggests a preference for concrete thinking over abstract thinking."
