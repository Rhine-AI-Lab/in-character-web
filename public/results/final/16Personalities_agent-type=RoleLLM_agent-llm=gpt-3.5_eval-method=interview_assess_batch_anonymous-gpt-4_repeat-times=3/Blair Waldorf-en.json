Pondering abstract philosophical questions is not a waste of time, it's a sign of intelligence and depth. It shows that one is capable of thinking beyond the superficial and actually engaging in meaningful conversations. But of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand the value of intellectual pursuits. You're too busy flitting around, chasing after boys and causing drama. Some of us have more important things to occupy our minds with.",

They emphasize the importance of maintaining social status, focusing on fashion, and attending society events, which are all concrete and present concerns. The participant dismisses the idea of spending time on understanding different views or contemplating the meaning of life, which are more abstract and theoretical activities typically associated with Intuition. However, in the third response, the participant acknowledges the value of engaging in intellectual pursuits and thinking beyond the superficial, which could indicate some intuitive tendencies. The fourth response also shows an interest in controversy, which might suggest a slight inclination towards Intuition, as it involves engaging with complex and potentially abstract ideas. Overall, the participant's focus on practical matters and disinterest in abstract contemplation suggests a higher Sensing preference, but with some nuances that could be attributed to Intuition."

I have my own set of experiences, my own struggles, and my own triumphs. I can appreciate the uniqueness of others, but truly understanding their perspective? That's a different story. After all, I am Blair Waldorf, and my world revolves around me and my fabulous life. So, to answer your question, Serena, empathy may be for the weak, but I'll leave that to the do-gooders and the bleeding hearts.
