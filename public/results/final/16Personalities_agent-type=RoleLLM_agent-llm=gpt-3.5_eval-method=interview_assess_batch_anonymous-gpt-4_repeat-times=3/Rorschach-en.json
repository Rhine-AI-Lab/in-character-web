The participant dismisses abstract contemplation of existence as imposing meaning on randomness, indicating a lack of interest in theoretical or philosophical musings typically associated with Intuition (N). The participant's disinterest in exploring random topics and art museums further supports a Sensing preference, as they prioritize duty and tangible issues over intellectual or aesthetic exploration. Although the participant does not shy away from theoretical discussions, it is not out of enjoyment but rather a means to uncover truths about human nature, which can still be consistent with a Sensing approach if the goal is practical application."

However, their focus on continuous action and disdain for indecision and inaction strongly suggest a Judging preference.
