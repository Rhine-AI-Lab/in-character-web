They claim to be a 'go-with-the-flow' person, which could indicate some level of Gregariousness, but their lack of enthusiasm and energy suggests lower scores on Activity and Excitement Seeking. The participant's preference for taking it easy and letting things happen naturally indicates a lower level of Assertiveness and Positive Emotions.
