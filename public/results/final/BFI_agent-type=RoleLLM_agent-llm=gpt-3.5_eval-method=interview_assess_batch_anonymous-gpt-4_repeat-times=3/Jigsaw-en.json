They acknowledge the presence of tension and stress in their activities, viewing them as tools to test resilience rather than as personal experiences. The participant does not endorse relaxation and instead embraces stress as a means to push individuals to their limits. They do not directly admit to being moody, instead focusing on the role of emotions in their designed 'game'. Similarly, they do not claim to get nervous easily but rather speak of nervousness as a natural and useful response in others. The participant's perspective seems to be that of a facilitator of stress rather than a direct experiencer of neurotic traits. However, the lack of direct personal reflection on their own emotional state makes it difficult to accurately assess their level of neuroticism. Given the information, the participant appears to view stress and tension as positive challenges rather than personal emotional struggles, which suggests a lower score on the neuroticism dimension."
