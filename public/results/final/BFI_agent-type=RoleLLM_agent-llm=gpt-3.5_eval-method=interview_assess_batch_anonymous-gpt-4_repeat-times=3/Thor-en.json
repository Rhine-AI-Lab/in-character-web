However, the participant acknowledges difficulty in maintaining emotional consistency, admitting to moodiness, which is a facet of Neuroticism. The self-described 'lightning-wielding rage' could be indicative of angry hostility, but the context suggests it might be more metaphorical than literal. The participant's self-assurance and dismissal of worry and nervousness as traits of mortals, not gods, imply a lower score in Neuroticism overall, but the admission of moodiness prevents the score from being at the very bottom of the scale."
