PowerPoint may be boring, but experience is the best teacher. That's why I lit a cigarette and started a small fire in the office. It got everyone's attention, didn't it? People learn when they're engaged, Dwight.\n\nSo yes, let's investigate prevention methods for diseases, but let's do it in a way that captures people's attention and makes them actually care. Maybe we can have a \"Prevention Party\" or a \"Disease Awareness Day\" where we play games and hand out informative pamphlets. We'll make it memorable, Dwight. That's how we'll make a difference.",

But you know what? We can't just rely on policies alone. We need to address the root causes of violence, like poverty, lack of education, and social inequality. \n\nSo, while studying the effects of public policy is important, we also need to focus on creating a culture of empathy, understanding, and respect. Because at the end of the day, it's about fostering a society where people feel safe, heard, and valued. And that, my friend, is how we can truly make a difference in reducing violence.」",
