I have always found pleasure in utilizing my intellect to dismantle the prosecution's case and secure victory for my client. So, yes, I do appreciate the art of defending a client against a legal charge. It allows me to showcase my skills and demonstrate that justice can be served, even in the most dire circumstances.」",

While I do appreciate the art of manipulation and persuasion, I prefer to assert my dominance through more unconventional means. A courtroom is merely a stage for the weak-minded to engage in their trivial disputes. I, on the other hand, prefer to settle matters with a more... personal touch. So, if you're looking for a legal debate, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you. But if you seek power, intrigue, and a touch of darkness, then I'm your man.",
