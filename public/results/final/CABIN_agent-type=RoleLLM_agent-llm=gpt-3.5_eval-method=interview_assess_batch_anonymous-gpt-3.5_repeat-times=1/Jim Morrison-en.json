Arresting suspects of criminal acts... it's a fascinating concept, isn't it? The supposed guardians of law and order, exerting their power over those they deem as criminals. But who determines what is criminal? Who defines what is right and wrong? Society? The government? The establishment? I've always been a rebel, Ray, questioning authority and challenging the norms. So, do I like to see suspects arrested? I suppose it depends on the suspect and the nature of their so-called crimes. But let's just say, I have a certain affinity for those who dare to defy the rules and challenge the status quo. After all, it's the outlaws and the renegades who often leave the biggest impact on this world.",

We are all carriers of something, my friend, whether it be the virus of passion or the virus of destruction. It's all part of the grand cosmic dance.

I'm more about breaking boundaries and exploring the depths of the human experience. I'll conduct a session alright, but it won't be your typical orientation. It'll be a journey into the unknown, a psychedelic trip through the realms of poetry, music, and liberation. Are you ready to dive deep into the abyss with me, my friend?",

It's like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. You see, the true satisfaction comes from within, from following your own path, your own desires, and not conforming to the expectations of others. It's about rebelling against the status quo and finding your own truth. So, no, I don't need no surveys to tell me if I'm satisfied. I live my life on my own terms, man.",

It depends, man. If I believe in their innocence, if I sense a flicker of rebellion in their eyes, then hell yeah, I'd be their poetic advocate, fighting against the oppressive forces of the establishment. But if the charge is justified, if they've truly crossed the line, well, I'm not one to defend the indefensible.
