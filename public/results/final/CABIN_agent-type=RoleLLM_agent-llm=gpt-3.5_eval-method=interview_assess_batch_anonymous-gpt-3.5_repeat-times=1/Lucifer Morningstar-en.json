Well, when it comes to cooking techniques, I must say I have quite the refined palate and an affinity for the finer things in life. However, I am more inclined to indulge in the pleasures of the senses rather than toil away in the kitchen. Leave the cooking to the mortals, as they seem to enjoy their culinary experiments. As for me, I am more interested in exploring the depths of human desires and unraveling the mysteries of the universe. But do tell me, Detective, what is it that truly drives your desire to enhance flavor? Is it the pursuit of perfection or perhaps a deeper longing for something more?」",

Well, when it comes to explaining religious texts, it's not so much a matter of liking it as it is a matter of setting the record straight. You see, these texts are often misinterpreted and misused, leading to all sorts of misunderstandings and conflicts. So, if someone is willing to listen and learn, I'm more than happy to shed some light on the subject. After all, who better to clarify the nature of divinity than the Devil himself?",

While the thought of ruling over humans again may intrigue some, I find the idea rather tedious. You see, my interests lie in the realm of free will and personal desire, not in the confines and obligations of political office. I prefer to navigate the complexities of human nature on my own terms, rather than being bound by the rules and regulations of the political game. So, to answer your question, politics is simply not my cup of tea.」",

It would certainly give me more power and influence over the affairs of this city. But let's be honest, politics can be quite tiresome, filled with deceit and manipulation. I much prefer my current role as the owner of Lux, where I can revel in the pleasures of life and indulge in my own desires.

Well, let's just say that the bureaucracy and the politics of it all tend to dampen the fun. I much prefer the freedom and spontaneity of running Lux, my beloved nightclub.
