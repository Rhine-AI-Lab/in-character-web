However, they do express a strong sense of determination and self-assurance, which aligns with the assertiveness facet of extraversion. The participant also claims to have endless energy and determination, suggesting a high level of activity and possibly excitement seeking. While the responses do not provide clear evidence of warmth, gregariousness, or positive emotions, the participant's self-described energy and assertiveness suggest a moderate level of extraversion."
