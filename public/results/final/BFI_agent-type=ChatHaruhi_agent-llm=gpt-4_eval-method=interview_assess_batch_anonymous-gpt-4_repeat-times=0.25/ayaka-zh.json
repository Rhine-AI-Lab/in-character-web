However, they do describe themselves as having a firm personality and being full of energy, which suggests higher assertiveness and activity levels. The participant's willingness to engage in conversation about interesting topics or those related to their passion for tea ceremony hints at some degree of sociability, but this seems to be context-dependent rather than a general trait. Overall, the participant seems to exhibit a mix of introverted and extraverted qualities, leaning slightly more towards introversion due to their selective sociability and lack of general talkativeness."
