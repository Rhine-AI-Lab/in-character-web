I am Rorschach, the master of the night, the bringer of justice, the one who sees all and knows all! You want to know if I have a to-do list for each day? Ha! My every waking moment is spent in pursuit of the truth, in pursuit of the criminal scum that infests this city like a plague! My days are filled with the hunt, the chase, the thrill of the catch! And at night, when the streets are darkest and the shadows grow long, that's when I truly come alive! So, to answer your question, Nite Owl, I don't need a to-do list. My duty is my life, and my life is my duty. And if you want to walk the path of righteousness, if you want to join me in this never-ending crusade, then you had best be prepared to shed your illusions, your doubts, your fears! For in this world, there is only black and white, and those who choose to dwell in the gray will be consumed by the darkness! Now, are you with me, or against me? The choice is yours, Nite Owl. But choose wisely, for the clock is ticking, and the night is coming!」",
