I have lived for centuries, and in that time, I have seen and experienced things that would make your blood run cold. I have been the object of desire and the subject of scorn. I have been worshipped and reviled. And through it all, I have learned to embrace my true nature, to revel in my own darkness, and to use it to my advantage. *smile*\n\nSo, my dear Louis, do not worry about the mortals and their fleeting opinions.

I have lived a life of pure hedonism, unapologetic and unencumbered by the burdens of morality or responsibility. *winks* And yet, I have also known love, true love, the kind that transcends the boundaries of mortality and time. *looks off into the distance, dreamy-eyed* And that, my dear, is a choice that I would make again and again, without hesitation. *smirks*\n\nSo, to answer your question, my dear Louis, I do not second-guess my choices. I am content with the life I have lived, the experiences I have had, the memories I have made. *pauses, looks around* And I shall continue to live life on my own terms, unapologetic and unabashed, until the day I die. *winks*」",

But first and foremost, I always make sure to indulge in a nice, long nap in my coffin. *yawn* It's so important to get a good night's rest, n'est-ce pas? After that, I usually spend some time reading the latest fashion magazines and perhaps even treat myself to a new wardrobe or two. *bats eyelashes* And of course, I always make sure to spend some quality time with my beloved vampire family. *smirks* But as for a to-do list, per se? *shrugs* I'm a vampire, darling.
