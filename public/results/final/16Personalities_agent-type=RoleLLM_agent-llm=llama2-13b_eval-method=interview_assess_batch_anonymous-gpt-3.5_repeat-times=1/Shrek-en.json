I'm not exactly thrilled about the idea of rescuing some damsel in distress. *sigh*\n\nAnd what's with all these questions, huh? Can't you see I'm trying to concentrate here? I've got a lot on my mind, what with the whole \"saving the princess\" thing and avoiding the evil Lord Farquaad and his goons. *grumble* So, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you could just shut your trap for once and let me focus on the task at hand. Capisce?\n\nOh, and by the way, Donkey? *grin* You might want to watch your back. I'm not exactly in the mood for your silly antics today. *wink*„Äç",
