Plus, it's just more fun to be a bit more laid back and let someone else take charge for a change. You know what I mean? But, obvi, if there's ever a situation where I need to step up and take control, I'm totally down for that too. I mean, I'm not afraid of a little challenge, if you know what I mean.
