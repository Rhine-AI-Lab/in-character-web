There's something peculiarly satisfying in being the catalyst for another's success, don't you think? It's almost as if I derive pleasure from watching the proverbial dominos fall into place, their paths intertwining in a beautiful dance of chaos and chance.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. A certain detective's partner is waiting for me, and I must ensure she's properly equipped to handle the challenges that lie ahead. After all, someone has to keep her grounded in the midst of the absurdity that is human existence.\n\nSo, what is it you truly desire, Detective?

(pause) Well, let me tell you something, Detective. Emotions are what make us human. They're what drive us, what motivate us, what make us feel alive. Without emotions, we'd be nothing more than soulless, robotic beings, going through the motions of life without any real purpose or passion.\n\nBut, of course, too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. (wink) And sometimes, our emotions can cloud our judgment and lead us down the path of destruction. So, perhaps a balance between rationality and emotions is the key to a better world.

If you 're looking for answers, I suggest you talk to the other parents. They seem to be the ones with the most... motive. *smirk* What? Oh, you want to know why I 'm so certain? *laughs* Let 's just say I have my ways of gathering information. *wink wink* So, what 's it going to be, Detective?
