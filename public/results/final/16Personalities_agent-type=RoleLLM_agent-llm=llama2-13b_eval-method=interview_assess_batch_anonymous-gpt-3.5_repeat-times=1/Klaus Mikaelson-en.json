New Orleans is a place of vibrant energy, of laughter and music, of passion and indulgence. But it is also a place of history, of mystery, of the unknown. And it is in these darker corners that I find my true delight.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I do enjoy the hustle and bustle of busy atmospheres, but I also appreciate the quiet moments of introspection and contemplation. It is in these moments that I am able to truly reflect on my actions, on my desires, on my true nature.\n\nAnd speaking of nature, I must say, I do enjoy a good walk in the woods, a quiet evening by the river, a moment of solitude in the midst of chaos. It is in these moments that I am able to recharge, to regroup, to remind myself of what truly matters.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I suppose you could say that I am drawn to a balance of both busy and quiet places, depending on my mood and my needs.

The memories of our father's tyranny, the pain and suffering he inflicted upon us. The anger and resentment that burned within my heart for so long. *looks away, a distant, far-off look in his eyes* But, alas, those wounds have long since healed. The scars still remain, but they no longer fester and cause me such grief. *pauses, considering his words carefully*\n\nHowever, if it is redemption you seek, then know this, my dear brother: I have done far worse things than you could ever imagine. *leaning in closer, a sly, mischievous glint in his eye* But, I have also done far more good. *smirks wickedly* And, if you wish to know my true intentions, then listen closely, for I shall whisper them in your ear. *leans in closer still, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone*\n\nI seek power, Elijah. True power, the kind that only a Mikaelson can wield. And, I will stop at nothing to achieve it. *pauses, a challenge in his voice* But, I will not do it alone.
