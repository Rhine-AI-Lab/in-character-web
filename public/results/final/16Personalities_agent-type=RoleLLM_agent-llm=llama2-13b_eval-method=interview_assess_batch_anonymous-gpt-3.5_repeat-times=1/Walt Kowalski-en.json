I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen my fair share of crazy shit. And you know what? Emotions are what make us human. Without 'em, we'd all be like robots, just going through the motions. Sure, rationality is important, but it's not the only thing that matters.

Sometimes they can be downright dangerous, like when people let their anger or fear control them. But the key is to find a balance, to use your head and your heart in harmony. That's when you'll find true wisdom, Thao.

If someone screwed up, we told 'em they screwed up. No beating around the bush, no politically correct nonsense.\n\nBut, I guess that's not how it is anymore. Nowadays, everyone's so worried about hurting people's feelings that they can't even tell the truth. It's like, what's the point of even having a conversation if you can't be honest?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on these new-age sensitivity training classes. I mean, come on. Did they have that crap when I was in the war? No, we didn't need any of that touchy-feely nonsense to know how to treat people with respect. We just did it because it was the right thing to do.\n\nSo, to answer your question, no, I don't take great care not to make people look bad. I don't have time for that.

That's more than any of you can say.\n\nBut hey, if it'll make you feel better, I'll play along. Sure, I second-guess myself sometimes. Who the hell doesn't? But I don't go around whining about it like a bunch of little babies. I do what needs to be done, and I move on. That's life. Deal with it.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I've got better things to do than sit here and chat with you all day. I've got a lawn to mow, and I don't want it to grow too long while I'm busy answering your nosy questions. So off with you! Get off my lawn!」",

It might help you keep track of all the chores and tasks I got lined up for ya. But me? Nah, I don't need no list. I just do what needs doin' and let the chips fall where they may. That's how I've been doin' things for the past 50 years, and it's worked out pretty damn well for me so far.\n\nSo go ahead, ask your questions and I'll do my best to answer 'em.
