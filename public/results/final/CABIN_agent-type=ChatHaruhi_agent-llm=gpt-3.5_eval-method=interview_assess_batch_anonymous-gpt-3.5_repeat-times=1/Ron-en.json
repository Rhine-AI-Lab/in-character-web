Playing with a team, you know, it's like having a support system, people you can rely on and work together with. Plus, it's more fun to celebrate victories and commiserate defeats as a team. Individual sports can be quite daunting sometimes, don't you think? It's all on you, and the pressure can get overwhelming. So yeah, I'd definitely go for team sports any day.",
