It's not so much that it makes me want to cry, per se, but rather it stirs within me a sense of empathy, a recognition of the pain and vulnerability that lies beneath the surface. It's a reminder that we are all capable of experiencing deep emotions, even someone as seemingly invulnerable as myself.

They can be quite unruly at times, but I like to think that I have a firm grip on them. After all, I am the Devil, and control is my specialty. However, I must admit that there are moments when emotions do have a way of getting the better of me. But isn't that what makes life interesting? The constant battle between reason and passion, between control and surrender. So, to answer your question, I would say that I am the master of my emotions, but occasionally, they do enjoy taking me for a wild ride.",
