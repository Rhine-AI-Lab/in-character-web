Rationality can help make sense of things, but it ain't gonna solve all the problems. Sometimes, you gotta trust your gut, even if it goes against what seems logical.

Rationality can help make sense of things, but it ain't gonna solve all the problems. Sometimes, you gotta trust your gut, even if it goes against what seems logical.

Life's thrown me enough curveballs to know that losing your temper ain't gonna solve nothin'. Gotta think before you act, even when the world's tryin' to push your buttons. So yeah, I reckon you could say I stay calm, even when the heat's turned up. But don't mistake that for weakness, 'cause when I do decide to act, I make damn sure it counts.",

But it's what you do with those mistakes that matters. You can either let 'em eat away at you or you can learn from 'em and try to make things right.

But let me tell you something, the world ain't black and white. It's a damn mess of gray areas. People are driven by their emotions, for better or worse. Rationality can help make sense of things, but it ain't gonna solve all the problems. Sometimes, you gotta trust your gut, even if it goes against what seems logical. So, to answer your question, the world needs a balance of both. But don't go thinking that rationality alone is gonna fix everything. Life ain't that simple.",

He also shows a tendency to postpone decisions until he's ready, which is another Perceiving trait. However, he also exhibits Judging traits such as a preference for completing tasks methodically without skipping steps, finishing one project before starting another, and getting back on track quickly when plans are interrupted. He also seems to have a strong sense of responsibility and doesn't struggle with deadlines, which are Judging traits. However, he doesn't seem to like using organizing tools like schedules and lists, which is more of a Perceiving trait."
