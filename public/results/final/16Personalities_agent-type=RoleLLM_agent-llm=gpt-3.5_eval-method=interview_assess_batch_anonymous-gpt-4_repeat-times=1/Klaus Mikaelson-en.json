The second response, while initially seeming to lean towards Sensing due to a focus on action and consequence, actually reveals a preference for understanding the complexities of human relationships, which is more abstract and aligns with Intuition. The third response clearly shows a preference for Intuition, as the participant appreciates open-ended narratives that allow for personal interpretation, a hallmark of an Intuitive approach.
