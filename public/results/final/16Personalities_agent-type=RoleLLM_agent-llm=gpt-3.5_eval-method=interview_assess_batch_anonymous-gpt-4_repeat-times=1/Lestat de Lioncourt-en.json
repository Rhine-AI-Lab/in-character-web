Well, my dear friend, while I do appreciate the power of literature and film to provoke thought and stimulate the imagination, I must admit that I prefer stories with a clear and definitive ending. I find satisfaction in closure, in knowing the fate of the characters and the resolution of their journeys. Life itself is already filled with enough uncertainties and open-ended questions, so when it comes to entertainment, I prefer a more conclusive experience. But of course, to each their own, mon ami. If pondering the mysteries of an ambiguous ending brings you joy, then by all means, indulge in it. After all, the beauty of art lies in its ability to evoke different emotions and interpretations in each individual.」",

I prefer to embrace the chaos and spontaneity that life as a vampire offers.」",
