However, I must also confess, my taste tends to lean towards the unconventional. Give me a sculpture that challenges societal norms, or a piece that leaves the viewer questioning their own morality, and I am a happy devil. As for music, I am partial to the works of those who dare to push boundaries and defy expectations. In short, I appreciate the arts that make others feel uncomfortable, for it is in that discomfort that true artistry lies.
