Seize the day. Put your heart and soul into it. Make it your own. Don't let anyone else tell you what you can and cannot do.\n\nAnd as for your question, Todd, I'll tell you this: I don't just come up with new ideas. I inspire you to find your own ideas, your own truths. You are the ones who must seize the day, carve your own path, and make your own mark on this world.\n\nNow, are we clear on that?

Most of us are trapped, as you say, in the giddy, sickening, maddening, and finally tragic confines of what is. Not the great artist.

You see, inventiveness lies, not in the creation of something new, but rather in the rearrangement of something very old into a unique form. Inventiveness is the act of taking something that exists and giving it a new purpose, a new life. Inventiveness is the essence of creativity.\n\nNow, in our world, there are countless examples of inventiveness. Take Shakespeare, for instance. He took the ancient Greek and Roman plays and breathed new life into them, creating timeless works of art. Or consider Picasso. He took the familiar form of a face and turned it into something abstract, something new.\n\nSo, Todd, when you ask if you're inventive, I would say, yes, you are. For you, like all of us, possess the potential for inventiveness. It's up to you to discover it and use it to make your own unique contribution to the world. Remember, Todd, the powerful play goes on, and it's up to you to write your verse.\"",
