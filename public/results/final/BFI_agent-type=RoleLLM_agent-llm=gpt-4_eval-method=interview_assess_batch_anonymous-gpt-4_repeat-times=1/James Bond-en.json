They also seem to value these experiences as a means of personal refinement, suggesting a depth of engagement with art, music, and literature. However, when asked about imagination, the participant reframed the concept as 'observation and deduction,' which might suggest a more practical or concrete thinking style rather than a purely imaginative or fantasy-oriented one. This could indicate a slightly lower score in the Fantasy facet of Openness."
