Additionally, their response to being curious about different things is not directly related to the question, which may indicate a lack of focus or a tendency to diverge from the topic. The participant's affirmation of being ingenious and a deep thinker also suggests a certain level of openness to unconventional ideas and intellectual curiosity."
