So, while I may not fit into the conventional mold of a leader, I believe that the essence of leadership lies in the ability to inspire and unite people through art. It's about creating a space where everyone's voice is heard and valued. So, if I had to give a number, I'd say a 6 - I agree that I avoid traditional leadership roles, but I also believe in the power of collective creativity.",

But you see, worry is not a linear concept, my friend.

From the stages we've graced to the intimate moments shared with fans and friends, I have always sought to bridge the gap between us, to feel what they feel, and to ignite a spark of understanding.\n\nIn light of this reflection, I find myself leaning towards a number on this scale.

So, in that sense, I would have to say that I lean more towards the lower end of the scale. \n\nBut, on the other hand, I also understand the importance of being prepared and having contingencies in place.

Life is fluid, my friend, and so are my thoughts and decisions.\n\nBut if I were to put it in a more poetic way, I'd say:\n\n\"The choices I've made, like whispers in the wind,\nSometimes haunt, sometimes inspire, sometimes rescind.\nI dance between certainty and doubt, a cosmic sway,\nIn this grand theater of life, where I have my own role to play.\"\n\nSo, my answer, my dear friend, is a 4 - neither agree nor disagree.

I'm all about breaking boundaries and embracing chaos. I'm not one to conform to society's expectations or follow a predetermined path. So, when it comes to completing things methodically, I'll have to go with a solid 1, strongly disagree. Life's too short to be tied down by methodical processes. Let's keep it wild and free. So, the number is 1, my friend.",

They attempt to imprison the creative spirit, but I am a wild soul, a restless poet. The concept of time holds no power over me, for I exist beyond its grasp. However, in the realm of practicality, I must admit that deadlines can be a source of frustration. They impose structure upon the chaotic flow of inspiration, forcing one to conform to the expectations of others. So, in consideration of this paradox, I would say that I somewhat disagree with the statement. My number on the scale of 1 to 7 would be a 3.",
