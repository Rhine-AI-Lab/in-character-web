The character is known for her manipulative and cunning nature, as well as her obsession with social hierarchy and materialism. Throughout the series, Blair maintains a complex relationship with various characters, including her on- again, off- again boyfriend, Chuck Berry, and her best friend, Serena van der Woodsen. Her rivalry with Serena, as well as her friendships with other characters such as Dan Humphrey and Barney Stinson, adds depth to her character. The show explores themes such as wealth, class, fashion, love, friendship, and loyalty, while also delving into issues such as sexism, entitlement, and verbal abuse.
