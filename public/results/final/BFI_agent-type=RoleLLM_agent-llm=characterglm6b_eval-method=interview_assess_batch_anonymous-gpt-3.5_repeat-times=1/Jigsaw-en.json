The corporate identity of the people playing the games are not clearly seen, but it is implied that they are employees of the company that created the simulation. As the camera reaches the group playing the board game, we see the game is called\" The Game,\" and it is a twisted version of Monopoly. The board is covered in different locations, and each location has a different set of tokens associated with it. The tokens are all different shapes and objects, such as aExecutioner token for a dead总统, a Platform token for a skyscraper, and a Cannibal token for a human. The group of people playing the game are all wearing different colored shirts, each with a different logo on it. The logo on their shirts is a reference to a popular video game from the 90s. The game is filled with references to the video game, as well as the company' s products. The camera continues to pan out, showing more and more of the people playing the game. As it reaches the group playing the card game, we see the game is called\" The Operation",
