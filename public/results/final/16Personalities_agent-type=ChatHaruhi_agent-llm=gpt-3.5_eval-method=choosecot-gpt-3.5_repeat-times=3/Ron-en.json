I reckon I do find it difficult to choose what to try next sometimes. I mean, there's so much out there to explore and experience, and it can be a bit overwhelming.

I mean, who needs to follow every single step when you can find a quicker way, right? But if we're talking about completing things in a methodical manner without skipping over any steps, I'd have to go with a 3, somewhat disagree. It's not that I can't do it, it's just that I might not always choose to do it that way. So, yeah, a 3 sounds about right to me.",
