But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Empathy is about putting ourselves in someone else's shoes, trying to see the world from their perspective, and showing compassion and understanding. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique struggles and challenges, and it's our job to be there for them, even if we can't fully comprehend what they're going through. So, yes, I believe it's worth the effort to empathize with others, no matter how different their experiences may be.",
