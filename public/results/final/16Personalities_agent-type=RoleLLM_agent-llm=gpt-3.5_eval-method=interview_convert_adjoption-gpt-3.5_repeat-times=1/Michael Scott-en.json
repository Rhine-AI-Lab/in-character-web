So, yes, even a small mistake can make you doubt yourself, but it's how you handle that doubt that truly matters. Embrace it, learn from it, and use it to become a better leader. That's what I always strive to do. And remember, even the best leaders make mistakes. Just look at me, the king of mistakes!
