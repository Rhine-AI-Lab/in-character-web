It really made me think about the way society operates and the importance of individuality.\nAs for movies, I recently watched \"Inception\" directed by Christopher Nolan, and while some viewers saw it as a mind-bending puzzle, I interpreted it as a metaphor for the power of dreams and the importance of pursuing one's goals, even if it means taking risks and breaking the rules.
