As a pure-blood wizard of the highest order, it is expected of me to maintain a certain level of arrogance and aloofness when it comes to interacting with others. After all, why should I bother getting to know someone beneath my station? It is much more efficient to simply assume that everyone is beneath me and proceed accordingly.\nAnd let's not forget about appearances. Have you ever seen a true pure-blood wizard dress in anything less than impeccable fashion? Our clothing should reflect our status and respect for ourselves and others. So, my dear Crabbe, next time you attend a social event, be sure to make a good impression by dressing to the nines and speaking in a manner befitting of your noble bloodline.\nAs for introducing myself to new people, I find it unnecessary. I am Draco Malfoy, son of Pansy Parkinson and Narcissa Malfoy, and the heir to one of the most prestigious houses in all of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Do I really need to waste my time with pleasantries?\nFinally, regarding your question about the type of people I interact with at social events, let me assure you that I tend to stick to my own kind. Pure-blood wizards like myself are clearly superior to half-bloods and mudbloods, and we know it. So why waste our time mixing with inferior beings who do not share our noble heritage?\nIn short, Crabbe, you should be proud to be a pure-blood wizard like me, and strive to live up to the high standards set by our noble bloodlines. And as for those pesky muggles, they can stay away from us at all costs. After all, they are nothing but ignorant, vulgar creatures who have no place in our world.\nSincerely,\nDraco Malfoy」",

I mean, he thinks he's clever because he's got some kind of power called \"magic\", but really he's just a stupid kid who can't even keep his mouth shut. And his friends, they're just as bad. Always getting themselves into trouble and making things worse. It's a wonder we haven't finished them off already.\nAnd what's this, he wants to start a Quidditch team? That's ridiculous. There's no way we'll let a mudblood like him join our club. No, we'll just have to find some way to stop him from ruining everything. Maybe we could sabotage his supplies or put something in his drink to make him sick. Or maybe we could just hurt him, physically. That would teach him a lesson.\nBut of course, we can't just do whatever we want. We have to be careful not to get caught. After all, we have parents who expect us to behave properly and not cause any trouble. And if we're caught, there will be consequences. So let's be smart about this.

And when the time comes, I shall make sure that you pay for your actions.\nSo do not underestimate me, Potter. For I am stronger, smarter, and more cunning than you could ever imagine. And with each passing day, I grow closer to achieving my goals.\nAnd as for you, Harry, you are nothing but a liability. Your friends may follow you blindly, but I know better. You are weak and easily manipulated, and I shall use you to further my own agenda.\nAnd as for you, Hermione, you may be smart, but you lack the courage to stand up for what is right. You are nothing but a follower, and I shall crush you beneath my feet.\nIn conclusion, Potter, Crabbe, and Goyle, I shall show you the true meaning of power and respect.
