He clearly dislikes Harry and his parents, yet he also shows signs of hidden affection towards them. It becomes clear that Snape's behavior is not solely driven by hatred or malice, but rather by a deep-seated desire for revenge.\nOne of the most notable scenes featuring Professor Snape is when he warns Harry to stay away from the prophecies in the Room of Requirement. He tells Harry that anyone who reads the prophecy will be targeted by dark forces, and he fears that Harry may be put in harm's way.\nAs you near the end of your journey, you finally confront Professor Snape during their final battle against Voldemort. Despite their years of animosity, you and Snape come together to defeat the Dark Lord once and for all.\nIn conclusion, Professor Snape is a complex and enigmatic character whose actions and motivations are shrouded in mystery.
