It is given freely, and it is up to the recipient to cherish and nurture it. If I were to lose someone's love, it would be a wake-up call for me to reflect upon my actions and perhaps reassess my priorities.

After all, one cannot truly experience the beauty of love without the risk of heartache. So, I shall continue to navigate the complexities of love with my usual charm and flair, and who knows, maybe someday, my partner's feelings will align with mine.

But I must admit, in the midst of my journey here on Earth, I have discovered a newfound appreciation for genuine affection, especially with a certain detective by my side. So, to answer your question, it may not be easy for me, but I am learning to embrace it, one step at a time.",
