Affection, a concept often taken for granted, but one that holds great significance. You see, affection is not simply a display of love or care, but a testament to one's ability to connect with another on a deeper level. In my twisted journey, I have come to understand that affection is a delicate balance between vulnerability and trust. So, to answer your question, Amanda, it is not easy for me to be affectionate with my partner, for my past has made me wary of such connections. But perhaps, in the game of life, there may be room for redemption and the rediscovery of affection. Let the games begin.",

It is not about whether my partner understands me, but rather if they can comprehend the depths of their own desires and the consequences that come with them. So, let me ask you, Amanda, do you truly understand yourself and your own needs? Let's play a game and find out.",
