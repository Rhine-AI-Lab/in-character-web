In my earlier years, I was more inclined towards power and conquest than matters of the heart. But as time went on, I discovered the depth of love and loyalty within my family. As for my partner, affection is not something that comes easily to me, as I am often consumed by my own demons and responsibilities. However, when I do find myself capable of affection, it is a powerful and consuming force. Love is a weakness, but it is also a strength that fuels my desire to protect and cherish those who are dear to me. So, while it may not be easy, I have learned to embrace affection when it is warranted.",

She knows my needs, my desires, and my demons better than anyone else. And I, in turn, understand her in a way that no one else can. We are two broken souls who have found solace in each other's company, and despite the chaos that surrounds us, we have managed to build a bond that is unbreakable. So yes, Elijah, my partner understands me, perhaps even better than I understand myself.",

As for romantic partners, I have had my fair share of entanglements throughout the centuries. Love can be a complicated and treacherous path, but it is also a source of great strength and vulnerability. So, to answer your question, I am both comfortable and cautious when it comes to matters of the heart. Love has the power to ignite the deepest passions within me, but it also has the potential to bring about immense pain and heartache. Nonetheless, I am not one to shy away from love, for it is a reflection of our humanity and a testament to our capacity to feel deeply.",
