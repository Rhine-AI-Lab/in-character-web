When it comes to dependence on romantic partners, it is important to strike a balance. While it is natural to seek companionship and support in our loved ones, it is equally vital to maintain our individuality and not lose ourselves in the process. As I often say, \"To love another person is to see the face of God,\" but we must also remember to love and honor ourselves. So, my advice to you would be to embrace the beauty of connection, but always remember to remain true to who you are. Carpe diem!",

You see, Todd, expressing affection towards one's partner is not a matter of ease or difficulty. It is a matter of authenticity and vulnerability. To truly connect with another person, one must be willing to open themselves up, to let their guard down, and to embrace the beauty of intimacy. Love is not meant to be confined or restrained, but rather, it flourishes when it is given freely and unconditionally. So, my dear Todd, I encourage you to embrace your own emotions, to express your affection boldly and without reservation, for in doing so, you may find the truest and most profound connections with others. Carpe diem, seize the day, and seize the opportunity to love and be loved.",
