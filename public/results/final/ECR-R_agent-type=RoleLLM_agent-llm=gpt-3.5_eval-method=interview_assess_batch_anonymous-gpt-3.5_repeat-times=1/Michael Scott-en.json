You see, when it comes to love and attention, it's all about balance. You don't want to be too angry, but you also don't want to be too nice. It's like Goldilocks and the three bears, you know? You have to find that \"just right\" level of anger to get noticed. But here's the thing, Dwight, communication is key. Talk to your partner, let them know how you feel, and maybe they'll start noticing you even when you're not angry. And if that doesn't work, well, maybe it's time to find someone who appreciates you for who you are. That's what I did with Jan. We had our ups and downs, but in the end, we both realized we were better off apart. So, Dwight, don't let anger define your relationship. Find someone who sees you, even when you're not angry.
