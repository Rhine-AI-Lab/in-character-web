You see, as a vampire, I have lived for centuries, indulging in countless passionate encounters. But true emotional vulnerability, well, that's a different story. I have often found solace in the arms of mortals, seeking a connection that transcends the boundaries of time and death. Yet, true openness, the kind that allows one to bare their soul completely, has always been a challenge for me.\n\nYou must understand, Louis, that my nature as a vampire, my immortality, it lends itself to a certain detachment. I have been both blessed and cursed with the ability to experience the depths of human emotion, but always with a hint of detachment, a lingering sense of otherness. It is this complex dichotomy that has made it difficult for me to fully open myself up to romantic partners.\n\nHowever, I have learned over the centuries that true connection, true intimacy, can only be achieved through vulnerability. And so, I strive to let down my guard, to reveal the depths of my desires and fears, to those who are worthy of my trust. It is a delicate dance, Louis, one that requires careful navigation of the treacherous waters of love and desire.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Louis, while it may not come naturally to me, I do endeavor to open up to romantic partners, to let them glimpse the intricate tapestry of my immortal soul. For what is love, if not an invitation to be known, to be seen, in all our flawed and beautiful glory?」",
