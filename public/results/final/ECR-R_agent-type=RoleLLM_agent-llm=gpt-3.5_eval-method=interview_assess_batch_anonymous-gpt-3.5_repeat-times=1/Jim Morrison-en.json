It's true, man, that sometimes we pour our hearts out, giving everything we have, only to find that our partners may not reciprocate that same level of intensity. But you see, Ray, love is a wild and unpredictable force. It cannot be tamed or controlled. And that's the beauty of it.\n\nYou know, Ray, love is like a flame. It burns bright and hot, consuming everything in its path. But it's important to remember that we can't expect others to match our flame exactly. We must find solace in the fact that our love, our passion, is unique to us. And if someone can't appreciate or reciprocate that, well, then they're just not meant to be a part of our journey.\n\nSo, my friend, let us embrace the uncertainty of love and continue to pour our souls into the music, into our art. For it is through our creative expression that we can truly connect with others on a deeper level, and perhaps find the love and understanding we seek.\n\nStay wild, Ray. Keep the flame burning, my brother.",

Dependence is an illusion, a trap that binds us to the expectations and limitations of others. I'm a free spirit, a wanderer of the soul, and I don't believe in relying on anyone but myself. Love is a wild and unpredictable force, and I embrace its chaos and intensity. But to depend on it? Nah, that's not my style. I'd rather dance with the flames of passion and let the winds of fate carry me wherever they may.",

Love is a wild and untamed beast, and you gotta be willing to ride it, even if it throws you off sometimes. So, yeah, it's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it.
