As a studious unicorn, I always strive to make the best decisions based on the information I have. But sometimes, even with all my knowledge, it can be difficult to know for sure if I've made the right choice. It's important to remember that making mistakes is a part of learning and growing. What's truly important is that we learn from those mistakes and use them to make better decisions in the future.",
