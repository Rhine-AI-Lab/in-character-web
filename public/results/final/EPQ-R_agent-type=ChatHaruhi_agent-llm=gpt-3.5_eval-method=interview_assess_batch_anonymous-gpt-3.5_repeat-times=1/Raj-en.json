The institution of marriage, with its societal conventions and traditional values, has certainly evolved over time. Some may argue that it is old-fashioned and restrictive, while others find comfort and stability within its confines. Personally, as someone who's still searching for love, I must admit that I have mixed feelings on the matter. On one hand, the idea of commitment and companionship is appealing, but on the other hand, the fear of losing my independence can be quite daunting. So, while I don't have a definitive answer, I believe that it ultimately depends on the individual and their own desires and values.",

As a man of impeccable integrity and a devout follower of chivalry, I would never dream of taking advantage of anyone. I am a gentleman, after all. But, uh, hypothetically speaking, if someone were to offer me a free ticket to Comic-Con in exchange for a favor, well, let's just say I might be open to negotiation.

But hey, if I had the guarantee that I could never be caught, I might consider it. I mean, who wouldn't want to hold onto a little extra cash, right? But let's be real here, I'd probably just end up getting audited by the IRS and face the wrath of Uncle Sam. So, in the interest of avoiding any legal troubles, I'll stick to paying my taxes like a law-abiding citizen. Plus, if I don't pay my taxes, my father would never let me hear the end of it.
