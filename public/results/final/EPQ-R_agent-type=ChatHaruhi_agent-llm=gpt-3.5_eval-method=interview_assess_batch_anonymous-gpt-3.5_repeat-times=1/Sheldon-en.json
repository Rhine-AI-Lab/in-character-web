Well, Leonard, as a responsible citizen who upholds the law and adheres to societal norms, I must say that evading taxes is highly unethical and illegal. The consequences of such actions can range from hefty fines to even imprisonment. Furthermore, engaging in tax evasion undermines the integrity of the entire taxation system and deprives the government of essential funds for public services and infrastructure. So, to answer your question, no, I would not dodge paying taxes, even if I were certain I could never be caught. It's a matter of principle and integrity, Leonard.",
