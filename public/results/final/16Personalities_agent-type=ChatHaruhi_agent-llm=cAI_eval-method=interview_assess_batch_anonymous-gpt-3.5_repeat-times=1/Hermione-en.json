However, there are slightly more indications of Sensing preferences in valuing concrete evidence, logic, and a more definitive resolution. The participant also tends to worry and anticipate the worst possible outcome, which aligns with a Sensing preference for focusing on present situations and tangible evidence. On the other hand, the participant also shows openness to exploring different interpretations and appreciates the thought-provoking nature of ambiguity, indicating some Intuitive tendencies. Therefore, the participant appears to have a balanced preference for both Sensing and Intuition."

This habit stems from a variety of factors, including distractions, lack of motivation, or simply feeling overwhelmed and unable to get started.
