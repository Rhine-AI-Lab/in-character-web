I'm a very cautious and risk-averse person, so I tend to put off making a final decision until the very last possible moment, if not slightly beyond, just in case a better option becomes available or something unexpected happens that would change my decision. This can sometimes lead to some really close calls and stressful situations, but it's just how I operate.」",
