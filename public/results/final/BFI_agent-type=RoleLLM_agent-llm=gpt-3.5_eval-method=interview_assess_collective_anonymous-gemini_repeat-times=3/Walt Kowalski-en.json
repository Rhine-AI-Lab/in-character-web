They display a preference for concrete thinking, practicality, and a resistance to new experiences and ideas. They value tradition and convention over novelty and exploration. They are not particularly interested in art, aesthetics, or intellectual pursuits. They prefer routine and familiar activities over challenging and stimulating ones.
