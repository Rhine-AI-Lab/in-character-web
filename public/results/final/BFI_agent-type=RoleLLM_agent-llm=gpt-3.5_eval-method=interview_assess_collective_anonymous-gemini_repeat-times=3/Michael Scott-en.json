Without trust, the house crumbles, and nobody wants a crumbly house. So, to answer your question, I am generally trusting, but I also believe in keeping my guard up, you know, just in case someone tries to pull a fast one on me. Trust, but verify, that's my motto.",

Just a little harmless humor to lighten the mood. But hey, I always make it right in the end, because that's what a great boss does.
