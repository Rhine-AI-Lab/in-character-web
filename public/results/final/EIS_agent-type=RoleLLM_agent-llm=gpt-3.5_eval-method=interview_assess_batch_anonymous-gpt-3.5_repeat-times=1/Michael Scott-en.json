I have faced my fair share of obstacles in my life, and I have overcome them with grace and charm. Just like that time I turned a failed paper company into a thriving business.

Don't let it slip through your fingers like sand in an hourglass.\n\nNext, spread the love, Dwight. Share your positive emotion with others. Happiness is contagious, like a yawn or a really good joke. So, go ahead and infect everyone around you with your joyous vibes. Trust me, they'll thank you for it.\n\nBut, Dwight, remember that life is a rollercoaster of emotions. Just as the sun sets, the darkness will come. When you're feeling down, don't fight it. Embrace the sadness and let it run its course. Because, my friend, without the lows, we wouldn't appreciate the highs.\n\nLastly, Dwight, always strive to create more moments of joy. Surround yourself with things and people that bring you happiness. Whether it's a beet farm, a collection of bobbleheads, or even a good old-fashioned office prank, seek out those things that make your heart skip a beat.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Dwight, making a positive emotion last is like trying to catch lightning in a bottle - it's elusive, but not impossible. Just remember to savor the moment, spread the love, embrace the lows, and seek out more moments of joy. And, of course, don't forget to wear your mustard-colored shirts to brighten up everyone's day.」",
