Uncertain times call for careful planning and logical thinking. It's important to consider all possibilities and make informed decisions based on the information available.

However, I also understand the importance of being prepared and working hard to achieve our goals. Optimism alone is not enough; we must take action and make the most of our opportunities. As Dumbledore once said, \"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" So, while I am optimistic about the future, I also understand the need for dedication and perseverance.」",
