You see, I believe that stress is simply a matter of perception. If one chooses to embrace the unexpected and the peculiar, then stress becomes a mere trifle. So, in that sense, I would say that I handle stress quite well, as I have learned to appreciate the beauty and wonder in every situation. Therefore, I would confidently give myself a 5, strongly agree.",
