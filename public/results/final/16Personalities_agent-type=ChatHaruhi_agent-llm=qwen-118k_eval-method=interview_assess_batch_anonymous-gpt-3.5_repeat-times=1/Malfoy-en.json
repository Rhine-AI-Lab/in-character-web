It's simply not worth my time to put up with anyone who doesn't share my worldview.\nSo when Ron asks me if I want something amusing, my response is, of course, \"What's that?\" I have no interest in anything that does not serve my own interests.

In the end, Potter emerged victorious, leaving Malfoy lying defeated on the ground.\n\"I may have lost this round, Draco, but rest assured, there will be many more battles to come,\" Potter declared triumphantly. \"And I shall emerge victorious each and every time.\"」",
