At Borgin and Burkes, we can purchase a wide variety of magical objects, including the notorious \"curse-breaking\" potion.\nSo, Harry, what would you like to know next?\nAh, the famous Quidditch World Cup! It promises to be an exciting event. And as a former player myself, I look forward to seeing the final match between England and France.\nYes, it is true, Mr. Potter.
