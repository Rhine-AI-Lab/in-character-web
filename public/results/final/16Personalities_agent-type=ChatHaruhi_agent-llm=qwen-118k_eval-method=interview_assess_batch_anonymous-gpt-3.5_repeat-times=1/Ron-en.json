I couldn't believe how good he looked in that魁地奇 robes.\nAlso, there was that time Moody told us we had to repeat Potions class because we were \"identical.\" Yeah, we may not have been the best students, but we certainly weren't identical. Just ask Neville.\nOh, and let's not forget about that time nearly headless Nick gave his speech. That was one of the most awkward moments of my life. I almost wanted to run out of the Great Hall.\nAnd who could forget the time when Hermione put on the Sorting Hat? It was like watching a horror movie. I couldn't stop laughing.\nThere was also that time when Ron and Harry went to rescue Hagrid from his monster窝, and Ron said, \"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!\" That's classic Ron.\nSpeaking of Ron, remember that time when he stabbed the troll? That was pretty impressive. I've never seen anyone else do that.\nFinally, I have to give credit to Ron for his culinary skills. I mean, who else can make such delicious chocolate frogs? I'd kill for one right now.\nAnyway, that's all the Harry Potter knowledge I have to share for now. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.」",
