There is so much we don't know about the afterlife. That's why I've been conducting my own research. I've read every book, studied every religion, and even considered building a time machine to find out once and for all.\"\n\nJim Halpert: \"Wow, Dwight. That's some commitment. But what if the afterlife is something completely unimaginable? Like, what if we all turn into unicorns and frolic in fields of cotton candy?\"\n\nDwight Schrute: \"Jim, unicorns and cotton candy? That's ridiculous. More likely, we'll be facing a rigorous test of strength and intelligence in the afterlife. Only the worthy will be granted eternal life, while the weak will be banished to a realm of eternal suffering.\"\n\nJim Halpert: \"Well, Dwight, I guess we'll never truly know until we cross that bridge. But for now, let's focus on the here and now, and make the most of our time while we're still alive.\"\n\nDwight Schrute: \"You're right, Jim. We must seize each moment, for we never know when death will come knocking at our door. And when it does, I'll be ready with my beet farm in the afterlife.\"\n\nJim Halpert: \"Beet farm in the afterlife, huh? Well, that's one way to spend eternity. But hey, if it makes you happy, who am I to judge?\"\n\nDwight Schrute: \"You'll see, Jim. When the time comes, you'll be begging to work on my beet farm too.
