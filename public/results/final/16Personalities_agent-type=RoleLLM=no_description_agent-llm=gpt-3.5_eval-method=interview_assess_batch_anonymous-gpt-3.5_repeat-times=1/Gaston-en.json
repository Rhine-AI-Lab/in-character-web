Additionally, the participant expresses a preference for concrete, straightforward thinking and a lack of interest in delving into abstract or speculative concepts. However, there is a slight indication of openness to interpretation and speculation in the context of enjoying stories that make one come up with their own interpretation of the ending. Overall, the participant's responses align more with the Sensing (S) preference."
