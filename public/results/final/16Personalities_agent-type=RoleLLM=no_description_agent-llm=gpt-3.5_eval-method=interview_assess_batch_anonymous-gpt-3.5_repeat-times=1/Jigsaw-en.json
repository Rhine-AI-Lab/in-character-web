It's exhausting, you know? Always second-guessing every decision, every action.\n\nNARRATOR: Amanda's hands tremble slightly as she clenches them together, trying to gather her thoughts.\n\nAMANDA: (with determination) But I've learned to channel that insecurity, that self-doubt, into something else. Something... darker.\n\nNARRATOR: The scene cuts to a flashback of Amanda in the infamous Jigsaw trap, her voice overlapping with her younger self's screams.\n\nAMANDA (voiceover): Jigsaw saw something in me. He saw the potential to overcome my insecurities, to face my fears head-on. And I embraced it. I became his apprentice, his instrument of justice.\n\nNARRATOR: The camera pans out, showing Amanda's face hardening with resolve.\n\nAMANDA: (firmly) So, yes, I may rarely feel secure, but I've learned to use that insecurity to my advantage. To survive. And to make others face their own insecurities in the most twisted ways imaginable.\n\nNARRATOR: The scene fades out, leaving a lingering sense of unease and uncertainty in the air.",

Additionally, she questions the effectiveness of to-do lists and prioritizes self-discovery and survival over getting back on track. These responses suggest a preference for exploring possibilities and adapting to unforeseen circumstances rather than adhering to structured plans and order."
