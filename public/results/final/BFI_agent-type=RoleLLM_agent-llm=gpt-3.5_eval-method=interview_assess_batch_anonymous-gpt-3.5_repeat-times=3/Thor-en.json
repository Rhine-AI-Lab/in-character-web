Well, I must admit, I have a fondness for the grandeur and beauty of Asgardian craftsmanship. The intricate designs of our weapons and armor, the majestic architecture of our palaces, and the vibrant colors of our realm are truly a sight to behold. But beyond that, I also appreciate the art of battle, the dance of combat, if you will. The way a well-executed strike can be both powerful and elegant, it's a thing of beauty. So yes, I do value artistic and aesthetic experiences, in my own thunderous way.",
