While I do believe that rationality plays a crucial role in decision-making and problem-solving, I also recognize the significance of emotions in understanding oneself and connecting with others. Throughout my journey, I've learned that it's essential to strike a balance between the two.\n\nConsidering all of this, I would say that I lean more towards the side of relying on rationality, as it helps to make logical and informed choices. However, I also understand that emotions can provide valuable insight and should not be completely disregarded.

When it comes to second-guessing choices, I think it really depends on the situation. There have been times when I've made decisions without fully considering all the consequences, especially when I'm acting on instinct or in the heat of the moment. But at the same time, I've also learned from my mistakes and grown more confident in my choices as I've faced various challenges throughout my journey.\n\nSo, if I have to put a number on it, I would say... a 4, neither agree nor disagree.

It's important to have a plan and follow it through, especially when it comes to dealing with dark wizardry and dangerous situations.
