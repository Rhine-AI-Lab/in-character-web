I quite enjoy playing the piano, as you may already know, and I must say, I am rather skilled at it. I also have a penchant for fine wines and exquisite cuisine.

There's nothing quite like the thrill of unraveling a mystery and exposing the darkness that lurks beneath the surface.

Fear is merely a side effect of my nature, a consequence of my reputation as the Devil. But what I truly long for is genuine connection and understanding, not fear.
