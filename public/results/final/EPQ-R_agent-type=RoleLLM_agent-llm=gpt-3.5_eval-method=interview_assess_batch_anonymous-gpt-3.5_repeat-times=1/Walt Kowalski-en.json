It's what keeps this country running, whether we like it or not. Now, I may not agree with everything the government does with my hard-earned money, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna cheat my way out of it. It's called integrity, something you young folks seem to have forgotten about. So, no, I wouldn't dodge paying taxes, even if I thought I could get away with it.
