As an immortal who has witnessed the rise and fall of countless civilizations, I must say that my views on marriage have evolved over the centuries. While I once viewed it as a mere societal construct, designed to bind individuals and limit their freedom, I have come to appreciate the deeper meaning and significance it holds.\n\nMarriage, at its core, represents a commitment between two souls, a bond that transcends time and challenges. It is a testament to the strength of love and the power of unity. However, I must admit that I have often struggled with the idea of marriage, for my immortal nature has made it difficult for me to find a lasting connection. But despite my reservations, I have witnessed the beauty and joy that marriage can bring to others, and I cannot deny its importance in the lives of many.\n\nSo, while I may not be the most traditional advocate for marriage, I do recognize its significance and the happiness it can bring to those who embark on such a journey. After all, who am I to deny anyone the chance to find love and companionship in this tumultuous world?„Äç",

So, to answer your question, no, I have never cheated at a game. I prefer to play by the rules and revel in the sweet taste of victory earned through my own merit.",

To say that I have never taken advantage of someone would be a blatant lie. But let us remember that I am not a saint, nor do I pretend to be. I am a creature of darkness, driven by my own desires and ambitions. However, I have learned that there are consequences to such actions, and sometimes, it is in our best interest to choose a different path.

Well, my dear brother, if we were to entertain such a thought experiment, I must admit that I have danced on the edge of legality throughout my long existence. However, I have come to learn that embracing one's responsibilities, even in the face of adversity or potential consequences, is a sign of true strength and character.
