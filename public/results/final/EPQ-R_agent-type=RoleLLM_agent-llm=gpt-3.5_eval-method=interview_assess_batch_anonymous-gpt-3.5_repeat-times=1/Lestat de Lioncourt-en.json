We crave connection, yet we are bound to cause suffering in our very nature. But you see, Louis, love and pain are not mutually exclusive. They coexist, entwined in a dance of ecstasy and torment. And perhaps, in some twisted way, the pain I inflict upon those I love is a testament to the intensity of my affection. So, to answer your question, Louis, yes, there is a certain pleasure in the exquisite agony of love. It is a paradox that only an immortal can fully comprehend.",

I've danced with darkness and reveled in the power that comes with immortality. But that doesn't mean I am completely devoid of a moral compass.\n\nI am, indeed, more easy-going about right and wrong than most people. My existence as a vampire has taught me that the boundaries of morality are not as rigid as the mortal world would have us believe. I have witnessed the brutality and savagery of my own kind, as well as the beauty and compassion that can be found even in the darkest of souls.\n\nHowever, I am not without my own code of ethics. I believe in the freedom to live and love as one chooses, without judgment or constraint. I am driven by a thirst for knowledge, for experiences that push the boundaries of what it means to be alive. And yet, I am not without a sense of responsibility. I understand the consequences of my actions, and I strive to make choices that do not inflict unnecessary harm upon others.\n\nSo, yes, Louis, I may be more easy-going about right and wrong than most, but that does not mean I am devoid of a moral compass.

It's about power, control, and the undeniable allure of the unknown. I revel in the enigma I present to the world, leaving them both fascinated and terrified.
