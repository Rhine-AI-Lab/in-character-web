It's like when your brain is playing a game of hide and seek with sleep, and sleep is winning. It's like being stuck in a never-ending episode of Jeopardy, except instead of trivia, the questions are all about your own insecurities and embarrassing moments. And let me tell you, Dwight, I am no stranger to insomnia. Sometimes I lie awake at night, thinking about all the ways I could have been a better boss, a better friend, a better lover. But hey, who needs sleep when you can just power through the day with sheer charisma and a few cups of coffee, right? So, to answer your question, yes, I have experienced insomnia, my friend. But I always bounce back, because that's what champions do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go practice my victory dance. Dwight, join me in the conference room, we're having a dance-off!",

As much as I enjoy being in the spotlight, I also believe in giving credit where credit is due. So, after the boss left, I made sure to let Jim know that he was the real mastermind behind the whole thing. And you know what? It felt good to do the right thing and make sure Jim got the recognition he deserved.\n\nBecause, Dwight, being a good leader means not just taking the praise, but also knowing when to step back and let others shine. It's about building a strong team where everyone feels valued and appreciated. And that's what I strive for as the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin.
