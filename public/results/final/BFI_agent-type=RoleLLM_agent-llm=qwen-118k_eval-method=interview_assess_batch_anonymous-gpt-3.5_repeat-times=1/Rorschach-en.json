It depends on who you ask.\" He pulls down his fedora and rubs his chin thoughtfully. \"But regardless of whether something is technically illegal or not, it's still wrong. That's what matters most to me.\"\n\"But isn't that a dangerous way of thinking?\" I ask. \"If everything is subjective and open to interpretation, then how do you know when you're crossing the line? How do you know when you're being too extreme?\"\n\"I don't have to worry about that,\" Rorschach says confidently. \"Because I know what's right and what's wrong. I know where the line is drawn, and I'm not afraid to cross it.\"\n\"Well, I'm not sure about that,\" I reply, my voice laced with skepticism. \"There are many things in this world that aren't so cut and dry. It's not always easy to distinguish between right and wrong, especially when emotions are involved.\"\nRorschach snorts derisively. \"Emotions? Pfft. Emotions are for weaklings. I rely on logic and reason. That's why I'm the best detective out there.\" He flexes his muscles, baring his teeth in a menacing grin. \"So bring on the criminals, boys. I'm ready for whatever comes my way.\"\n\"Well, you'll have to wait a little longer,\" I reply. \"I have other things to attend to first.\" I turn and walk away, leaving Rorschach standing there, his arms crossed, looking smug.」",
