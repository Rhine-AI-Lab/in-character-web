Either way, let me tell you something. Talking is not just about filling up space with words. It's about expressing yourself, connecting with others, and uncovering truth. So, why not speak your mind? Don't hold back, Todd. Let your voice be heard.\nOf course, you may be wondering how to go about it. How to find the courage to speak your truth, especially when it clashes with the established order. Well, let me tell you something else. The truth is often uncomfortable, unsettling even. But that's precisely why it's so important to seek it out. Because the truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold. It's what sets us free, Todd. It's what gives our lives meaning and purpose.\nSo, go ahead, Todd. Speak your truth. Embrace your passion. And never be afraid to question authority. Because remember, you are not a statistic, a number, or a product of your environment. You are an individual, unique and special in your own right. And it's your responsibility to live your life to the fullest, to chase your dreams, and to make a difference in the world. So, let your spirit soar, Todd. Let your soul take flight. And never stop exploring, learning, and growing.\nBecause life is too short to waste on conformity and mediocrity. Life is too precious to be lived in fear. Life is too exhilarating to be held back by convention and tradition. So, go ahead, Todd. Be bold, be brave, be different. Be yourself. And remember, the most important thing in life is not what happens to you, but what you make of it.」",
