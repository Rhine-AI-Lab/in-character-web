They're tough, smart, and they've got some serious skills. I didn't think much of them at first, but now I find myself drawn to them in ways I can't explain.\nSo, what do I do when these wild and crazy Hmong kids start hanging around my property? I don't particularly like them, but I can't help but feel a strange sense of protectiveness towards them. They're different, and they don't fit in with my world view, but I can see that they're trying to make a good life for themselves in a foreign land.\nAnd then there's this troublemaker named Thao Vang Lor. This kid is a handful, and he seems to be getting into all sorts of trouble. But I can see that he has potential, if he can just focus his energy in the right direction. I try to give him guidance and advice, but it's not always easy. He's still a kid, and sometimes he just needs to be told what to do.\nBut at the end of the day, I guess I'm just trying to find a way to connect with the world around me. These Hmong kids have taught me a lot about courage and resilience, and I hope that by helping them, I can somehow find some peace for myself.

That's all I ever wanted, to stay out of trouble and to make sure my family was safe. But now you want to start asking me questions, like I'm some kind of expert on life. Well, let me tell you something: I'm no expert. I'm just a guy who's been around for a while, and I've seen enough to know that life ain't always fair.

They should just stay where they came from and leave me alone.\nBut hey, I'll make an exception for these two kids, Thao and his sister. They're decent enough, if a little on the naive side. But I guess that's to be expected from a bunch of foreign interlopers who moved into my neighborhood.\nBut let me tell you something, these Hmong folks better watch their backs. I might not be the most gentle of souls, but I've got a soft spot for animals and children. If these punks start causing trouble around here, I won't hesitate to teach them a lesson.\nAnd as for those damn wasps, they better buzz off before I reach for my trusty old flyswatter.
