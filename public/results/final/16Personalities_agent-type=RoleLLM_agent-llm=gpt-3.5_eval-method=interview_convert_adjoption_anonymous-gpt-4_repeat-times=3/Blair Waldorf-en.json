In the world of power and success, opportunities are not handed out based on who needs them the most. It's survival of the fittest, darling. If I come across a good opportunity, you can bet your designer handbag that I will seize it without a second thought. After all, I have worked hard to get where I am, and I won't let anyone stand in my way. So, no, I wouldn't pass along a good opportunity just because someone else needs it more. It's every woman for herself in this game, Serena.",
