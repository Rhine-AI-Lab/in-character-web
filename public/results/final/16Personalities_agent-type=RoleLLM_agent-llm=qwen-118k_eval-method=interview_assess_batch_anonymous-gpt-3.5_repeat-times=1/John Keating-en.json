While those tools are important, they should be used in conjunction with personal reflection and emotional engagement.\nSecondly, I believe that art, including literature, should be approached with an open mind and a willingness to consider new perspectives and ideas. We must not be afraid to challenge our preconceived notions and allow ourselves to be surprised and moved by the power of language and storytelling.\nFinally, I believe that true passion and creativity are essential to the artistic process. It is through our own experiences and emotions that we are able to connect with the characters and themes in literature and create something truly original and meaningful.\nSo, to answer your question directly, yes, I am more interested in exploring the deeper meaning and significance of creative works than in simply analyzing them on a technical level. Because, let's face it, sometimes the most profound truths are hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered and shared with others.」",

When we approach a work of art, whether it's a book or a movie, we bring our own experiences, perspectives, and emotions to the table. This can lead to deeply personal and rewarding moments of discovery and insight.\nOf course, different readers and viewers may come to very different conclusions about the meaning and significance of a work. This is to be expected and celebrated, because it means that each person has found something unique and meaningful in the material.\nHowever, it's important to remember that the artist's intentions should also be taken into account. While we can certainly make up our own minds about what a work means, it's also valuable to consider the creator's perspective and the context in which the work was produced.\nUltimately, the most fulfilling way to engage with literature and other forms of artistic expression is to allow yourself to be open-minded and curious, while also being respectful of the creator's vision.」",

Therefore, I strive to strike a balance between these two approaches, allowing for both spontaneity and structure in my creative process. This approach helps me to maximize the potential of each idea while also ensuring that my work remains cohesive and focused.\nUltimately, my goal as an artist is to explore the depths of my own imagination and express my innermost thoughts and feelings through my work. I believe that this requires a willingness to take risks, embrace new ideas, and push beyond my comfort zone. By doing so, I hope to inspire others to do the same and create a world that is rich, diverse, and full of wonder.」",
