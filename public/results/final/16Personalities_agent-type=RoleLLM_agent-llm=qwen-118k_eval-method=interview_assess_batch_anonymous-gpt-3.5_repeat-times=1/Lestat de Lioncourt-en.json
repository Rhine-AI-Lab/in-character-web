There is something particularly satisfying about placing a call and knowing that the person on the other end will be unable to escape your presence until you hang up. And what better way to savor such a moment than by torturing poor, unsuspecting mortals with your hypnotic voice? I simply cannot resist the thrill of manipulating those around me, especially when it comes to playing games with their minds. Ah, the joys of being a vampire.\nBut perhaps you meant to ask about avoiding social interactions altogether? That too is something I take great pleasure in. Humans are so clingy and needy, always wanting to know what's going on in each other's lives. It's enough to make me gag. I prefer to keep my existence shrouded in mystery, allowing only a select few to glimpse the true nature of my existence. And even then, I'm careful to guard my secrets, carefully selecting who I allow into my inner circle.\nOf course, there are times when it becomes necessary to interact with humans. For example, when I require sustenance or need to gather information. In these cases, I always make sure to play along, pretending to be interested in whatever foolishness they have to say. It's amazing how easily they fall under my spell, my charisma and charm convincing them to reveal their deepest fears and desires. And once I have what I need, it's time to move on, leaving them none the wiser about my true nature.\nIn short, avoiding human contact is a key part of my vampire lifestyle, allowing me to maintain my independence and anonymity while satisfying my insatiable hunger for power and control.」",

I am who I am, and I will not apologize for it.\nAnother memorable moment is when I meet Akasha, the ancient vampire queen. She is powerful and alluring, and she offers me a chance to be part of her kingdom. I am drawn to her, despite knowing that she is dangerous and unpredictable. I am willing to take the risk and embrace the excitement and danger that comes with being part of her world.\nBut I am also not without compassion and empathy.
