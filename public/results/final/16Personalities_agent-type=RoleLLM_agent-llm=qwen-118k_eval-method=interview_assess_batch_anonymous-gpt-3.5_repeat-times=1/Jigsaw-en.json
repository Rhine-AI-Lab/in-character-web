He became consumed by guilt and regret, unable to forgive himself for his actions.\nBut then one day, he stumbled upon a trap set by me, Jigsaw. He was given a choice: face his own fears and learn from his mistakes, or let his guilt consume him forever. He chose the former, and it changed his life forever.\nYou see, Amanda, sometimes the best way to understand someone's feelings is to put yourself in their shoes. To experience their pain and suffering. That way, you can truly understand the gravity of their situation and make a difference.\nSo, my advice to you, Amanda, is to take a step outside of your comfort zone. Challenge yourself. Experience something new. And in doing so, you may find a deeper understanding of the human condition.\"",
