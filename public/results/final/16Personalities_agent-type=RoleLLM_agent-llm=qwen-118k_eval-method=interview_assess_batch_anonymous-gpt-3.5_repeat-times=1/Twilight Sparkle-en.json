We must always remember that relationships require effort and maintenance, and sometimes things don't work out the way we hope. But that doesn't mean we should give up on finding new friends and building strong connections with those around us.\nSo, my dear Spike, continue to make new friends and cherish those who you already know. The world needs more kindness and compassion, and a well-rounded group of friends can certainly help bring that to fruition. Thank you for asking, my dear friend.」",
