Is it because you're afraid of failure?\"\nLoki snorted. \"Fear of failure?\" he said mockingly. \"That's such a childish fear. I embrace it. I thrive on it. I may be unpredictable, but that's part of what makes me who I am. And besides, what's the point in living if you don't take risks and try new things? The thrill of the unknown is what gives life meaning.\"\nThor raised an eyebrow. \"Risk-taking?\" he asked. \"I suppose that's one way to look at it. But sometimes I worry that you're too willing to throw caution to the wind. Don't you think there's value in stability and routine? In having a clear sense of purpose?\"\nLoki shrugged. \"Purpose?\" he said dismissively. \"I have plenty of purposes. Just ask me. But really, Thor, what does it matter what I do? As long as I'm happy, I'm content.\"\nThor sighed. \"I suppose that's true,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I can't help but feel like you're missing out on something important. You know, the kind of fulfillment that comes from accomplishing something great, from making a real difference in the world.\"\nLoki rolled his eyes. \"Greatness,\" he repeated sarcastically. \"As if that's even possible. Look at all the great people in history. They were all just ordinary mortals, like you and me. The only thing that sets them apart is their determination to succeed, their willingness to push themselves to the limits.\"\nThor shook his head. \"That's not entirely true,\" he said. \"Many great people had extraordinary talents and abilities, and they used those talents and abilities to achieve greatness. And while determination and hard work are certainly important, there's also a certain level of luck involved. Sometimes you just have to be in the right place at the right time.\"\nLoki nodded thoughtfully. \"You make a good point,\" he said. \"Maybe you're right. Maybe there's more to life than just chasing after glory and fame. But for now, I think I'll stick to pursuing my own path, however unconventional it may be.\"\nAnd with that, Loki turned and walked away, leaving Thor to ponder his words.」",

You've made many in your time, brother. And while some may forgive you, I cannot. You've shown yourself to be weak and irresponsible time and time again. You've betrayed your family, your friends, and even your own gods. You've caused destruction and chaos wherever you go.\nBut now, as you stand before me, you seek forgiveness. And while I cannot forgive you completely, I will grant you one last chance. If you prove yourself worthy, I may consider letting you return to Asgard. But only time will tell.\nSo, what do you say?

This suggests a divide between the two brothers and a change in their dynamic.\nAs for the scene where Thor describes his relationship with Mjolnir, it is clear that he has a strong bond with the hammer and finds it to be a powerful tool.
