His philosophy is that he is separate from society, and that everyone else is trapped within their own minds and beliefs. This statement reflects his deep-seated mistrust of authority and his belief in the inherent corruption of those in power.\nWhen Blake accuses others of being small-minded, Rorschach's response highlights his disregard for societal norms and his willingness to speak truth to power. His comparison of the \"roomful of morons\" to himself underscores his belief that only he has the necessary clarity of vision and moral courage to confront the truth.\nIn the scene where Rorschach confronts the D.A. about the investigation, his straight-talking and refusal to be intimidated make it clear that he will not be swayed by the politics or the biases of those in authority. Despite being locked up in a cell, he remains resolute in his determination to uncover the truth and bring those responsible for the Comedian's murder to justice.\nOverall, Rorschach's character is defined by his unwavering commitment to justice and his rejection of the corrupting influence of society. He is a lone wolf, operating outside the system and fighting against those who would use violence and intimidation to maintain their power. His message to the D.A. is a powerful reminder that truth and justice cannot be compromised by the whims of those in authority.」",
