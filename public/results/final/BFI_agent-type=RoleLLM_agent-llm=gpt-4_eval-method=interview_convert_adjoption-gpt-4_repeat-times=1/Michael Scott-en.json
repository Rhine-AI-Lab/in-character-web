You know, like the Mona Lisa, that painting of the lady with the mysterious smile. And who can forget Beethoven's Fifth Symphony? Da-da-da-dum! Classic. And as for literature, I've read some great books, like \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and \"The Da Vinci Code.\" So, yeah, I may not be sophisticated, but I know what I like. And what I like is a good time!",
