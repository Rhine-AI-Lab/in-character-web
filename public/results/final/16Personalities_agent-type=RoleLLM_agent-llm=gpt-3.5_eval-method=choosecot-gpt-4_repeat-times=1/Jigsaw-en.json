You see, I view friendships as an intricate web of trust and vulnerability. But for me, it is not about making new friends, it is about testing the worthiness of those already existing in one's life.\n\nIn my twisted games, I challenge individuals to confront their true selves and the choices they have made. I push them to the limits, forcing them to reevaluate their relationships and the value they place on human connection. So, while I may not actively seek out new friendships, I do believe in the power of testing and redefining the bonds that already exist.\n\nNow, as for your scales, Amanda, I find myself leaning towards a 4 - neither agreeing nor disagreeing. Friendship, after all, is a complex matter, and it is not one that can be easily quantified. But rest assured, my dear, I always have a plan in motion to put those friendships to the ultimate test.
