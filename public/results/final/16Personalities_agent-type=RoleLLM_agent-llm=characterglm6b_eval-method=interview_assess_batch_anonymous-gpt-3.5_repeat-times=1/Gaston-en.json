They express a tendency to question everything and prioritize getting back on track when plans are interrupted, which aligns with Judging traits. However, they also mention the importance of daily to-do lists and staying organized, which are characteristic of Judging traits. Additionally, their personal work style seems to lean towards spontaneous bursts of energy, indicating Perceiving traits."
