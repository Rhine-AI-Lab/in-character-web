While I appreciate the attempt to quantify such complex concepts, I must inform you that I find these scales inadequate for capturing the intricacies of my character. However, if I must conform to your limited options, I shall reluctantly provide an answer. In this case, I would have to select 3, neither agree nor disagree. As a highly logical and organized individual, I do possess certain coping mechanisms that allow me to handle stress in a manner that may be perceived as relaxed. However, it is important to note that my exceptional intellect and meticulous nature often prevent me from experiencing stress in the same way as the average person. So, in conclusion, I find this question both oversimplified and lacking in nuance.\"",
