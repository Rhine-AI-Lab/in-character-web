If they are swayed by my charisma and charm, well, that is simply a side effect of my nature. But I do not manipulate, I inspire, I provoke, and I challenge.

Flattery is just one facet of my irresistible allure. So, yes, I have used flattery to my advantage countless times, for it is a skill that comes naturally to me.
