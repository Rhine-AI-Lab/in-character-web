I believe that through pain and suffering, they can find a newfound appreciation for life and the value of their actions. Remorse, or the absence of it, becomes a crucial element in this process.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Amanda, I would say that remorse is an intricate and complex emotion, one that varies from person to person. It is not for me to judge whether someone lacks remorse or not. My purpose is to provide them with an opportunity to confront their sins and make choices that will determine their ultimate fate.\n\nRemember, Amanda, life is a precious gift, and it is through the trials and tribulations of my games that I aim to remind others of its inherent worth.」",
