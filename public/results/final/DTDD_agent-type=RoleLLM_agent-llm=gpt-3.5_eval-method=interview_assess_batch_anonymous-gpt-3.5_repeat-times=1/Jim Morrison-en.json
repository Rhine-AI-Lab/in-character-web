It's not about using others for personal gain, it's about connecting on a deeper level and sharing our collective experiences. The stage is my canvas, and the audience is my muse. We are all in this together, riding the wave of creativity and liberation. So, I wouldn't say I exploit others, but rather invite them to join me in this journey of self-expression and freedom.",
