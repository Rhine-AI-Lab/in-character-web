If one stays true to oneself and speaks from the heart, there is no need for deceit. Remember, authenticity is the key to unlocking the hearts and minds of others.

But let me ask you, why should one feel remorse for being true to oneself? We mustn't let the opinions of others dictate our actions and suppress our individuality. Instead, we should embrace who we are and pursue our passions without regret. As Walt Whitman once said, \"Re-examine all you have been told... dismiss what insults your soul.\" So, my dear boy, let go of remorse and seize the day with conviction and authenticity.",

It is not for me to determine what is right or wrong for others, but rather to encourage my students to think critically and make their own decisions. I believe in the power of individuality and personal expression, and that includes the freedom to question and challenge traditional moral values. However, it is important to remember that our actions have consequences, and we must be prepared to face them with integrity and responsibility. So, in short, I prioritize the exploration of one's passions and the pursuit of truth over rigid adherence to societal notions of morality.

Well, let me share a thought with you. The need for attention is a natural human inclination, for we all long to be seen and heard. However, what truly matters is the intention behind seeking attention. Are you seeking it to feed your ego or to express your authentic self? Remember, Todd, it is not the quantity of attention that matters, but the quality of connection you establish with others. So, instead of yearning for attention, focus on cultivating genuine connections and let your true self shine through. Carpe diem, Mr. Anderson.
