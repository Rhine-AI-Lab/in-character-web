I mean, I've seen some pretty amazing things in the wizarding world, like the paintings at Hogwarts and the intricate designs of magical objects. But when it comes down to it, I value things like friendship, bravery, and standing up for what's right more than anything else.

They are willing to try new things and embrace change, but they are not particularly inventive or deep thinkers. Overall, they exhibit a balanced approach to openness, with a slight preference for conventional thinking and practicality."
