I prefer to live in the moment, to seize every opportunity that comes my way. Ideas, on the other hand, well, they are like whispers in the wind, tantalizing and ever-changing. I am not one to dwell on them for long. But I must say, there is a certain thrill in exploring new concepts, in pushing the boundaries of what is known.

Art, music, and literature are the very essence of my existence, my raison d'être. I have traversed the centuries, immersing myself in the works of the greatest minds and talents, from the Renaissance masters to the Romantic composers, from Shakespeare to Baudelaire. I have witnessed the birth of new artistic movements and have even contributed to the cultural tapestry myself. So, to answer your question, Louis, sophistication is but a mere understatement when it comes to my relationship with art, music, and literature. They are the lifeblood that courses through my immortal veins.」",
