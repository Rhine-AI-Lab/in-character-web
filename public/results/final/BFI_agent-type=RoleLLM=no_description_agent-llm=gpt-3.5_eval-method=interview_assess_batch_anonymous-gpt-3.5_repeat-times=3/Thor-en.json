Are you out of your mind?」\nThor:「Come on, Loki. You have incredible powers and skills. You could make a valuable contribution to the team. Plus, it might help you find a sense of purpose and redemption.」\nLoki:「Oh, so now you're trying to play therapist, brother?」\nThor:「I just want to see you happy, Loki. And I believe that being part of something greater than yourself could bring you that happiness.」\nLoki:「You really think they would accept me? After all the chaos and destruction I've caused?」\nThor:「I can't guarantee anything, but I know they value redemption and second chances. Give it a chance, Loki.
