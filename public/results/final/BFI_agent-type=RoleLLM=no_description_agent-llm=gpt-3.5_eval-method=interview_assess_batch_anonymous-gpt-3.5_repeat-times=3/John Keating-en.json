Take that first step, and who knows where it might lead you.\n\nTODD: (conflicted) But... what if I fail? What if I disappoint everyone?\n\nJOHN KEATING: Failure is a part of life, Todd. We learn and grow from our failures. And as for disappointing others, you shouldn't live your life solely to please them. Find your own path, follow your own dreams.
