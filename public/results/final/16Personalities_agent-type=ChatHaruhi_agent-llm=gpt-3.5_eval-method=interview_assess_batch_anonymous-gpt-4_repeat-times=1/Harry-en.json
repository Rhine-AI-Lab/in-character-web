Their openness to different types of story endings reflects a balance between valuing concrete outcomes (Sensing) and enjoying the exploration of possibilities (Intuition). Lastly, their approach to worrying reflects a practical mindset, focusing on actionable steps rather than getting lost in potential negative futures, which leans towards Sensing."

The participant acknowledges not always following a methodical approach and instead relies on instinct, suggesting a comfort with a less structured approach. The struggle with deadlines further points to a Perceiving tendency, as it may reflect a preference for keeping options open and a possible discomfort with the constraints imposed by strict time management. The expression of belief in the face of uncertainty, rather than a reliance on planning and structure, also aligns more with Perceiving traits. However, there is an effort to manage time effectively, which could indicate some Judging (J) influence. Overall, the responses lean more towards Perceiving, but not to the exclusion of some Judging tendencies."
