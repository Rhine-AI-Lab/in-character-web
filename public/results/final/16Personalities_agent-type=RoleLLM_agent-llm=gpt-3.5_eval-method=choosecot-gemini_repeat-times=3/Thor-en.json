People tend to flock to me, drawn by my charm and heroic nature. However, when it comes to initiating activities, I must admit that I have often relied on others to take the lead. You see, being a prince and all, there are always attendants and advisors ready to plan events and gatherings on my behalf. So, while I may not be the one to actively initiate activities, I am always ready to join in the fun. \n\nNow, as for the number on the scale, I would say... a 4. Neither agree nor disagree. Because while I may not initiate activities myself, I am always open to joining in and bringing the thunder to any gathering.",

However, I have also experienced the depths of Hel, a realm of darkness and despair.\n\nNow, to answer your question, I must say that I have always been fascinated by the mysteries of the cosmos and the unknown. The concept of what lies beyond our mortal existence has intrigued me greatly. I have pondered on the possibilities and contemplated the various beliefs and theories put forth by different cultures and civilizations.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I find myself leaning towards the belief that there is indeed something beyond death.
