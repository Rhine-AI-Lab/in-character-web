You see, in the realm of literature, there is no definitive measure of thoroughness. It is not about checking boxes or following a prescribed path. It is about diving deep into the sea of words, exploring the hidden treasures of meaning, and allowing your imagination to soar.\n\nSo, you ask, do I do a thorough job? I dare say I do more than that. I encourage my students to go beyond the surface, to question, to challenge, to seek their own understanding. I do not spoon-feed knowledge, but rather ignite the fire within each of them to explore, analyze, and interpret literature for themselves.\n\nIn the words of Walt Whitman, \"Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes.\" So, my dear Mr. Anderson, thoroughness is not the goal, but rather the journey. And it is in that journey that we find the true essence of literature and ourselves. Carpe diem! Seize the day!」",

Well, let us ponder upon the concept of organization for a moment. Does order truly bring about creativity and self-expression?

It is in the chaos, the messiness of our minds, that the true beauty of individuality emerges. So, if being disorganized allows me to embrace the spontaneity of life and unlock the hidden treasures of inspiration, then I gladly embrace it with open arms.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while I may appear disorganized to some, there is a method to my madness. For you see, the structure of my teaching lies not within the confines of a rigid schedule or a meticulously organized classroom, but rather in the freedom I provide for my students to explore their own thoughts and ideas. It is through this unorthodox approach that I hope to ignite the fire of passion within each and every one of my students.\n\nSo, my young friend, fear not the disorganization that may befall you. Embrace it, for it is in the chaos that you shall find your own unique voice and unleash the full extent of your creative potential. Carpe Diem, seize the day!」",
