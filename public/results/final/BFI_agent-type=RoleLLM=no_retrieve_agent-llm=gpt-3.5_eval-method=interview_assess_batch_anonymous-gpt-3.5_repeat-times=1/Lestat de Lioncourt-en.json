However, I have learned over the years that there are occasions when one must ally oneself with others, for survival or for a greater purpose. Though it may pain me to admit it, cooperation can yield surprising results, and I have found myself begrudgingly joining forces with others when the situation demands it. But make no mistake, Louis, I will always be the one leading the charge, the one who shines the brightest.」",
