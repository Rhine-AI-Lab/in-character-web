Life hasn't exactly been a fairytale for me, you know. But that doesn't mean I give up or let it bring me down. I face the challenges head-on, with a scowl on my face and a donkey by my side. So, no, I don't expect the best, but I sure as heck won't let the worst stop me from fighting for what's mine.",

I've faced worse than a bridge over boiling lava. I've battled dragons, rescued princesses, and survived countless encounters with annoying fairy tale creatures. So, yeah, things might go wrong, but I always find a way to make it right. Trust me, Donkey, we'll get through this. Just stick by me, and try not to get on my nerves too much.",
