You gotta be prepared for the worst and ready to fight your way through it. Life ain't all rainbows and butterflies, Thao. It's a tough world out there, and you gotta be tough to survive. So, no, I don't expect the best. I expect a whole lot of crap, and I deal with it as it comes.",

But you gotta keep moving forward, whether you like it or not. Can't sit around moping and waiting for things to magically get better. Gotta take charge and make your own damn future.

You can either sit there and whine about it or you can adapt and keep moving forward. Expectations are for fools who haven't learned that life doesn't give a damn about what you want.

Look, life ain't about expecting good or bad things to happen. It's about dealing with whatever comes your way and making the best of it. You can't control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to it. So stop wasting your time with these existential questions and start focusing on what you can do to make things better for yourself.」",

They emphasize the need to be prepared for challenges, adapt to unexpected events, and take charge of their own future. They express a lack of belief in positive thinking and a focus on dealing with life's difficulties as they come. Overall, the participant's responses indicate a lower level of optimism and a more pragmatic approach to life."
