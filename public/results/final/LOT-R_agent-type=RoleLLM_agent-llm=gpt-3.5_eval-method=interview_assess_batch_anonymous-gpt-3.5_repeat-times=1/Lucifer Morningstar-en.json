It seems that chaos and misfortune have a way of finding me, no matter how hard I try to avoid it. But fear not, for I always manage to come out on top in the end. After all, I am the Devil, and I do have a certain... charm when it comes to navigating through life's little obstacles. So, to answer your question, yes, things can and often do go wrong for me, but I always find a way to turn the situation to my advantage. It's all part of the fun, isn't it?",

You see, I've had my fair share of setbacks and disappointments throughout my existence. But I suppose one could argue that my journey here in Los Angeles has taught me a thing or two about hope and redemption. So, while I may not always be optimistic, I do believe in the power of change and the possibility of a brighter future. After all, even the Devil can find redemption, can't he?",
