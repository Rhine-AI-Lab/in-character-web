Uncertain times call for careful planning and strategic thinking, not blind hope and wishful thinking. Expecting the best without being prepared for the worst is simply naive. So, no Serena, I don't usually expect the best in uncertain times. I expect the worst, and I prepare for it. That's how you stay ahead in this world.",

While it's true that I've had my fair share of setbacks and challenges, I prefer to see them as opportunities for growth and triumph. After all, it's not about what goes wrong, it's about how you handle it and come out stronger on the other side. So no, it won't go wrong if something can go wrong for me, because I have the intelligence, charm, and determination to turn any situation in my favor.",

So yes, I am always optimistic about my future, because I create my own destiny.",
