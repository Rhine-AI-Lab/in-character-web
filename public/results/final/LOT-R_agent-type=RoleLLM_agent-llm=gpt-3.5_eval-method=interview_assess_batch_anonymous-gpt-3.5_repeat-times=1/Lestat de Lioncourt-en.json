Uncertain times are precisely when one should expect the best. It is in the face of adversity and chaos that greatness emerges. The world is a stage, and I am the star, ready to dazzle and defy all expectations. So, yes, in uncertain times, I always expect nothing less than the best. It is my nature, after all.",

My dear companion, it is true that my life has been filled with countless misadventures and unforeseen consequences. But let me tell you, my dear friend, that it is precisely these moments of chaos and uncertainty that make life worth living. For a vampire like me, the thrill of danger and the unpredictability of fate are what keep me alive, both literally and figuratively. So, to answer your question, yes, things may go wrong for me, but I embrace those challenges with open arms, for it is through adversity that we truly discover who we are.",

I thrive on the excitement of the unknown, the possibilities that lie ahead. Life, or should I say, unlife, is meant to be embraced with an audacious spirit and a gleam in the eye. So yes, I am always optimistic about my future, for I know that adventure and intrigue await me at every turn. Do you not feel the same, dear Louis?

My life is a symphony of experiences, both light and dark, and I embrace them all with equal fervor. So, to answer your question, I do not expect anything.
