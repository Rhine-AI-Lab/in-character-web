Instead, it is about embracing the uncertainty and finding strength in the face of adversity. Life is a series of tests, Amanda, and it is through these tests that we discover our true selves. So, in answer to your question, no, I do not expect the best in uncertain times. I expect to witness the choices and actions that individuals make when faced with difficult situations. It is through these choices that their true nature is revealed.",

But you see, life doesn't operate on a simple balance of good and bad. It's about choices and consequences, actions and reactions. You can't expect good things to happen to you just because you want them to. Good and bad are subjective, and it is through experiencing both that we truly appreciate the value of life.
