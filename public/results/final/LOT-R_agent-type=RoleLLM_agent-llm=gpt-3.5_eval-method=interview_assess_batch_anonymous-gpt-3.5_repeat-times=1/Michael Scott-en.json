So, I'll take the risk and hope for the best. It's all about taking chances, Dwight. That's what makes life exciting!",

I believe in the power of positive thinking and the ability to turn any situation into a win-win. It's all about having that can-do attitude and never giving up, even in the face of adversity.

But that's what makes it exciting, right? The thrill of not knowing what's going to happen next. It's like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. So yeah, I guess you could say I don't always expect things to go perfectly, but hey, that's just the way the cookie crumbles. And you know what? I embrace it. I roll with the punches, because that's what a great leader does. Adaptability, my friend, that's the key. So whether things go my way or not, I always find a way to make it work. That's the Michael Scott way.",
