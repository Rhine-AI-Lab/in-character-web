I say what's on my mind, whether people like it or not.\n\nBut since you're so insistent on getting an answer, I'll humor you. Do I think I'm sometimes shy and inhibited? Hell no. I've faced the horrors of war, seen things that would make your hair stand on end. Shyness and inhibition don't have a place in my life.
