Art, a medium through which emotions and messages are conveyed. To determine my level of interest, I must first contemplate the nature of art itself. Artistry can be found in the intricate design of my traps, the symbolism of life and death interwoven in my games. However, traditional forms of art, such as painting or sculpture, do not hold my fascination. They lack the element of choice, the essence of survival that drives my work. Therefore, I shall choose the number 2, for I a little disagree with the notion that I have few artistic interests.」",
