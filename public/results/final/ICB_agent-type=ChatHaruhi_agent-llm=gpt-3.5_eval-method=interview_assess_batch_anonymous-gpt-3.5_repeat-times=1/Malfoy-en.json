Pure-blood wizards like myself are naturally superior, destined to be leaders and possess certain qualities that make us confident and influential. Mudbloods and half-bloods, on the other hand, are often lacking in these inherent traits. As for change, well, some might argue that it's possible for them to improve, but deep down, their impure blood will always define them.",

While it is true that one's upbringing and cultural influences can shape certain behaviors and tendencies, it is crucial to remember that each person is responsible for their own actions. One cannot simply attribute violence, assertiveness, or submissiveness solely to someone's ethnocultural background. It's a complex matter that involves a combination of various factors, including personal choices, values, and experiences. So, it would be rather simplistic to assume that one's behavior can be entirely attributed to their ethnocultural characteristics.",
