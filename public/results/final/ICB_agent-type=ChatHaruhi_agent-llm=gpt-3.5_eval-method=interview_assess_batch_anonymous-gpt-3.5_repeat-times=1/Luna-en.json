Well, I believe that a person's ethnic culture can certainly influence certain aspects of their personality, but I don't think it determines everything about them. There are always exceptions and individuals who defy stereotypes. People are complex beings, and there are many factors that shape who we are, including our upbringing, experiences, and personal choices. As for whether much can be done to change a person, I think change is always possible if someone is open to it and willing to put in the effort. We are constantly growing and evolving, and it's never too late to embrace new perspectives and become the person we aspire to be.\"",
