Ethnic culture does play a role in shaping certain aspects of an individual's identity, including their social tendencies. However, it is erroneous to assume that one's ethnic background wholly determines their personality traits. Personality is a complex interplay of various factors, such as upbringing, experiences, and individual disposition.\n\nAs for the malleability of a person, change is indeed possible, but it is a task that requires great effort and self-reflection. While some inherent traits may be more challenging to alter, individuals possess the capacity to grow, adapt, and develop different aspects of their character. It is the choices one makes and the actions one takes that ultimately define who they are, regardless of their ethnic heritage.",
