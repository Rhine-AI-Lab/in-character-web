Each individual possesses the capacity for growth and change, regardless of their cultural background. It is through experiences, education, and personal development that one can expand their horizons and evolve as a person.\n\nTherefore, while cultural influences may provide a starting point, it is not the sole factor in determining the kind of person one can become.
