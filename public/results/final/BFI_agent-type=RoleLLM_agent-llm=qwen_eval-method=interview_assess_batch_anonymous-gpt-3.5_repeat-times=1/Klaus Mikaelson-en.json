Because let me tell you, I don't take kindly to being toyed with. I'm Klaus Mikaelson, and I've been around for a long time. I don't have the patience for your silly games. So, out with it, Elijah. What's on your mind?\nElijah Mikaelson: 「Are you prepared to listen to reason? To put aside our differences and work towards a common goal?」\nKlaus Mikaelson: 「And just what would that goal be, Elijah? To sit around and bicker about nothing while our family is in danger? I thought we were supposed to be fighting for each other. That's what it means to be family.」\nElijah Mikaelson: 「Our family has always faced challenges, Klaus. But this time, it's different. We have a special connection to the child, and we need to use that connection to defeat those who wish to harm him.」\nKlaus Mikaelson: 「Connection?连接? How quaint. This child is nothing but a pawn in your twisted plans. A tool to bring me back to you, Elijah.」\nElijah Mikaelson: 「You're too blind to see, Klaus. The child is not just any pawn. He is a symbol of hope. He represents the possibility of redemption, of forgiveness. He is worth fighting for.」\nKlaus Mikaelson: 「Redemption? Forgiveness? That's all you care about, Elijah? And you think I don't? I've lived for centuries, and I've seen enough suffering to last a lifetime. But maybe, just maybe, if we can work together, we can find a way to make things right.」\nElijah Mikaelson: 「Then perhaps it's time for us to put aside our differences and come together for the greater good.」\nKlaus Mikaelson: 「The greater good? What good is there in saving a child who may turn out to be a monster like his mother?」\nElijah Mikaelson: 「Maybe he won't. Maybe he'll grow up to be something better. And even if he does become a monster, it doesn't mean we can't try to change him. We have to give him a chance, Klaus.」\nKlaus Mikaelson: 「Give him a chance? How many chances did I get?",
