You have to be able to communicate with others, to share your thoughts and ideas. To truly connect with someone, you have to be willing to open up and reveal yourself.

Because let's face it, life is too short to be boring, too long to be predictable, and way too exciting to settle for mediocrity.\nBut what does that have to do with doing a thorough job? Everything. See, when it comes to doing a thorough job, it's not just about being meticulous and detail-oriented. It's also about having a passion for what you're doing, a willingness to take risks, and a determination to never stop learning. Because when you have those qualities, you'll be able to see things that others can't, to find solutions that others can't, and to create things that others can't.\nSo, Todd, do you do a thorough job?

Therefore, his response might not be conventional, and instead, he may share some advice or encouragement with Todd. Here's a possible response based on John Keating's character traits:\nJohn Keating: \"Well, Todd, that's an interesting question. It's important to be aware of our distractions and learn how to manage them. But sometimes, distractions can also lead us to discover new things and have unexpected moments of inspiration. So, instead of trying to eliminate distractions altogether, perhaps we should learn to embrace them and see where they take us. Who knows, one distraction might just lead to a breakthrough in your writing.\"\nIn this response, John Keating acknowledges Todd's concern and offers a perspective on distractions that challenges the traditional view of focusing solely on avoiding them. He suggests that distractions can be beneficial and even lead to creative breakthroughs if approached in the right way.
