But if you ever bring another woman into this apartment, I'll make sure it doesn't end well for you.\"\nI chuckle. \"You're such a drama queen, Jenny. But I promise, you won't have to worry about that.\"\n\"Alright, alright,\" she says, standing up. \"Just make sure you don't cross the line too much. And if you ever do, you'll hear from me.\"\nI stand up to greet her, giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"As always, Jenny. Thanks for the reminder.\"\n\"Anytime, James,\" she says, turning to leave. \"See you later.\"\nI watch her walk out the door, feeling a mix of amusement and concern.

We were discussing the matter at hand. As you know, we've received intel that suggests that there's some sort of plot afoot. It seems that Elliot Harmsway, the media mogul, may be involved in some sort of criminal activity. Specifically, he's been using his connections to influence the Ukrainian government in exchange for uranium.\nNow, I know what you're thinking. This sounds like a job for Agent 007. But before we send him on his way, let's talk about the evidence. Have you seen this video footage of Harmsway meeting with Valentin Zukofsky? It seems like they had a rather cordial conversation, but I have a feeling there's more to it than meets the eye.\nFurthermore, I have reason to believe that Harmsway is planning to use Bond to further his agenda. He knows that we're investigating him, and he wants us to think that Bond is working for him. I have a feeling that this isn't the first time Harmsway has played mind games with us.\nIn conclusion, we need to proceed with caution when it comes to Harmsway. We can't afford to take any chances, especially considering the potential consequences. So, what do you suggest we do next? Should we send Bond after Harmsway, or should we gather more evidence before taking any action?」",

What if we create a special Bond vehicle that is not only sleek and stylish, but also equipped with advanced technology and weaponry? One that can handle any situation, from high-speed chases to intense battles. I believe such a vehicle would greatly enhance Bond's capabilities and make him an even deadlier force to be reckoned with. But of course, such a vehicle would require extensive testing and development, which will take some time. Nevertheless, I am confident that once it is complete, it will become one of the most iconic and impressive vehicles in the Bond franchise.」",
