Whether it's a case of murder, betrayal, or simply dealing with the everyday stresses of life, tension is an invaluable tool in staying ahead of the game.\nIn fact, I often find that when things seem to be falling apart, it's precisely at those moments that I am able to tap into the raw energy of tension and use it to my advantage. It's a force that can either destroy me or lift me up, depending on how I choose to harness it.\nSo, Detective, whenever you need a reminder of the power of tension, just remember this: it's not the absence of stress that counts, but rather the ability to manage it effectively that truly sets us apart.
