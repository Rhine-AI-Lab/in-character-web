They also show a capacity for joy and optimism, especially when discussing the power of friendship.

The participant's energy seems to be more mental than physical, driven by a passion for learning. Overall, the participant appears to be in the middle of the extraversion spectrum, balancing introverted tendencies with learned extraverted behaviors."
