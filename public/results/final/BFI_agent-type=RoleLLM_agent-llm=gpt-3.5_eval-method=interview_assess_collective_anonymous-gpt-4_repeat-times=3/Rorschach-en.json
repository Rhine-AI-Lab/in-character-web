They also describe themselves as silent, solitary, and driven by a sense of justice rather than a desire for interpersonal connections or high activity levels.

They reject the notion of being emotionally unstable or easily upset, instead describing themselves as driven by a 'burning rage' and a 'relentless pursuit of justice.' Despite this, the participant acknowledges not handling stress well and not being calm in tense situations, suggesting a level of emotional reactivity. The participant's self-description indicates a complex relationship with emotions, where they perceive themselves as strong and resolute, yet their language suggests a high level of emotional intensity and potential volatility. This could be indicative of high neuroticism, as they seem to experience strong emotions and a sense of being overwhelmed by the 'weight of the world's sins.' However, their self-perception as unwavering and not prone to worry or nervousness complicates a straightforward assessment."

Despite this, there are indications of high levels of anger and hostility, as well as a self-described 'burning rage' and a self-concept as a 'hurricane of vengeance', which align with the Angry Hostility and perhaps Impulsiveness facets of Neuroticism. The participant also acknowledges not handling stress well and not being emotionally stable, aligning with the Vulnerability facet. However, the participant's self-description suggests a complex personality that may not fully align with high Neuroticism as they also exhibit a strong sense of control and purpose, which could mitigate the overall score. Given the mixed responses, the participant may score above average on Neuroticism due to the presence of anger and instability, but not extremely high due to their sense of control and purpose."
