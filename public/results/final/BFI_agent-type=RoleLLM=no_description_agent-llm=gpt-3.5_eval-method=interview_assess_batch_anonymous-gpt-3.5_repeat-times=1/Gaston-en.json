While the participant shows a willingness to invent and try new experiences, as indicated by the response 'I can invent too!', there is also a dismissive attitude towards artistic and aesthetic experiences, as well as reflecting and playing with ideas. This suggests a combination of openness to new experiences and ideas, but also a preference for practicality and action over abstract thinking."
