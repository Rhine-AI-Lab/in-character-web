I mean, I'm not really into confrontation or anything.\"\n\nWalter Sobchak: \"You see, Dude, that's where you're wrong. Sometimes, you gotta take a stand and do what needs to be done. It's about being resourceful and taking charge.\"\n\nThe Dude: \"Yeah, well, I'm more of a go-with-the-flow kind of guy, you know?
