As for handling stress, well, I believe that stress is often a result of conforming to societal expectations and suppressing one's true passions. So, I encourage my students to find their own paths, to follow their hearts, and in doing so, they discover a resilience and inner strength that helps them navigate through the challenges that life throws their way. So, in short, I believe in embracing stress as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.\"",

As I always say, \"No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.\" So, while I encourage my students to engage with their peers and learn from one another, I also emphasize the importance of thinking for oneself and embracing one's own unique perspective. After all, it is through the exploration of our own thoughts and ideas that we truly discover who we are and what we are capable of. So, to answer your question, I believe in the power of cooperation, but I also believe in the power of individuality.",

Artistic and aesthetic experiences are not merely valuable, but essential to our existence as human beings. They allow us to connect with the deeper truths and emotions that often elude us in our day-to-day lives. They awaken our senses, ignite our imaginations, and inspire us to see the world in new and profound ways. So, yes, my dear boy, I do value artistic and aesthetic experiences, for they are the very essence of what it means to be alive.\"",

So, no, I do not prefer routine work. I prefer work that challenges the status quo, that ignites the fire within us and allows us to express our unique perspectives and talents.",
