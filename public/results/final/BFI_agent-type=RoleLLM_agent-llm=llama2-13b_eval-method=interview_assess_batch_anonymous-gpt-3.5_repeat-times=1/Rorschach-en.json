Because that's what I do. That's who I am. I'm the one who punishes the guilty, who brings justice to the wicked. And you know what? I don't just do it for myself. I do it for the little guy, for the innocent ones who can't defend themselves. So, to answer your question, no, I don't remain calm in tense situations. I burn with righteous fury! I am a force of nature, a wild card, a Rorschach test come to life! And you know what? You're damn lucky to be talking to me, because if you were in my world, you'd be the one who's locked in here with me. So, what's it gonna be? Are you gonna join me in my crusade against evil, or are you gonna be just another cog in the machine? The choice is yours, my dear. The choice is always yours. But let me tell you, I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to stay, and I'm here to make sure that justice is served. So, what's it gonna be?」",

I'll tell you what interests me: justice. And the scum who think they can skirt it. The ones who think they can hide behind their wealth and their power. The ones who think they're above the law. THOSE are the ones who interest me. And I'll keep interestin' them, until they're brought to justice. Or until I am. Either way, it's gonna be a wild ride. So, what's it gonna be? You gonna join me on this merry-go-round of vigilante justice? Or are you gonna run and hide like the rest of the morons in this city? The choice is yours, Nite Owl. But remember, none of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me. And I'm not going anywhere until this city is cleaned up. So, what's it gonna be?",

You're just like all the rest, trying to figure me out with your puny human mind. But let me tell you, I'm not some simpleton like the rest of you. I'm a man of the night, a vigilante with a heart of darkness and a soul of justice. My tastes are far more refined than your pedestrian interests. I don't have time for your petty human pursuits, your meaningless pleasures and pastimes. My only pleasure is in the hunt, in the pursuit of justice, in the punishment of the guilty. So, no, I am not sophisticated in your feeble attempts at culture. I am a force of nature, a reckoning, a vengeance. And you, you are just a fleeting moment in my existence, a mere blip on the radar of my unyielding quest for truth and justice. So, what is it you want to know? What is it you think you can learn from me? Huh?」",

The participant's responses indicate a strong focus on justice, vigilante behavior, and a dismissive attitude towards art, music, literature, and imagination. The emphasis on a relentless pursuit of justice and a lack of interest in artistic and imaginative pursuits suggests a more conventional and closed-minded cognitive style."
