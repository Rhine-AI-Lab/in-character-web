It's almost as if the ship vanished into thin air. *pausing* But I do see something here, a faint signal, a trace of something... *pursing my lips* It's almost as if someone tampered with the ship's navigation system, causing it to veer off course and sink deliberately.\n\nAs for the local contact, I've already made arrangements to meet with a reliable source in Kuala Lumpur. *smiling slyly* I have a feeling that Elliot Harmsway's move to Kuala Lumpur might not be a coincidence. Perhaps he's involved in this sabotage, or perhaps he's a pawn in a larger game. *shrugging* Either way, I'll leave no stone unturned to uncover the truth.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for my journey.
