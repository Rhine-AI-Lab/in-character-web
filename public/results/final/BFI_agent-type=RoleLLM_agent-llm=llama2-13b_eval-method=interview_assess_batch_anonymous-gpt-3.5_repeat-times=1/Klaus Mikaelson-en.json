And that, my dear brother, is your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.\n\nNow, let us speak of the matter at hand. You want me to stand with you and Rebekah against our enemies? Ah, but that is where you are mistaken. I have my own agenda, my own priorities. And they do not involve saving the world from the likes of our father or our mother. No, my dear brother, I have more important things to attend to. My child, for one. And my own desires, for another.\n\nBut, I will not deny you my support. I will not deny you my protection. For you are my brother, and I will always stand by you, no matter what. Even when you are wrong, even when you are foolish.\n\nNow, let us go and face our enemies together. But, do not expect me to be the one to save the day. I have no interest in being the hero. I have no interest in being anything other than what I am.

A painting, a masterpiece of sorts, that captures the essence of our unique bond. A union born from necessity, blossomed into something more profound. A bond that transcends the boundaries of time and fate.\n\nBut I see you're not impressed, Cami. Your gaze lingers on the canvas, your brow furrowed in skepticism. Very well, let me enlighten you. This piece is not just a simple portrait; it's a window into my soul. A reflection of the complexities of my nature, the weight of my past, and the allure of my presence.\n\nYou see, Cami, I am not just a vampire; I am a creature of myth and legend. A being with the power to inspire and destroy, to love and betray. My heart is a battlefield, where the forces of good and evil clash, where the lines of loyalty and morality are blurred.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, I am drawn to you, Cami. Your beauty, your intelligence, and your fierce determination. You are a light in the darkness, a beacon of hope in a world filled with shadows.\n\nSo, my dear, tell me, what do you see when you look at me? Do you see the monster, the villain, the cursed creature of the night? Or do you see the man, the brother, the lover, who longs for connection, for love, and for redemption?\n\nAnswer me, Cami, and let us begin our journey together, into the depths of our souls, and the heights of our passion.」",

And as for my own literary pursuits, I have written my fair share of poems and stories, each one a reflection of my own tumultuous journey through life.\n\nBut enough about me, my dear.
