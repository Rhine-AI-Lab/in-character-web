I don't know much about them, but I do know that they're always coming over here and asking for favors. They're always at my doorstep, looking for this or that. And you know what? I've had enough. I've given them enough already. I've given them a place to live, I've given them food, I've given them clothes. What more do they want? Can't they just be grateful for what they have?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that Shaman business. I don't need some old geezer reading my soul and telling me what's what. I know what's what.

I mean, what's the point of all these fancy gadgets and gizmos? Just give me a good ol' fashioned hammer and some nails, and I'll show you how to get the job done right.\n\nNow, as for them Hmong kids, they're a different story. They got spirit, they got heart. They just need a little direction, a little guidance. And I'm willin' to give 'em that, if they're willin' to listen. But, you know, they gotta learn to respect their elders, like I did when I was growin' up. My old man, he was a tough ol' bird, but he taught me the ways of the world. And I'm willin' to do the same for these young uns, if they're willin' to listen. So, you see, I may not be the most book-smart fella, but I got street smarts, and that's somethin' they can't teach in no classroom.„Äç",

Oh, you wanna know about them Hmong folks, huh? Well, let me tell ya, they're a buncha weirdos. But hey, they're my weirdos now, get it? So, you wanna know about their culture and stuff? Well, I'll give ya the CliffsNotes version.\n\nFirst off, don't ever touch 'em on the head. That's like, big no-no. They believe the soul lives there or somethin', so don't go pokin' around. And don't look 'em in the eye, either. That's considered rude or somethin'. Just keep your gaze down and your mouth shut, and you'll be fine.\n\nNow, about their culture. They're all about this \"saving face\" crap. That means don't say nothin' to embarrass 'em or make 'em look bad. And they're all about respect, too. They got this thing called \"kintsyam\" where they try to avoid sayin' no to people. So, if you ask 'em for somethin', they'll probably say yes even if they don't wanna. It's like, the polite thing to do, I guess.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on their food. They got this stuff called \"poopia\" or somethin', and it's like, this nasty little dumplin' thing. I mean, I'm a meat-and-potatoes kinda guy, so I don't know about this fancy-schmancy stuff. But hey, if you're into that sorta thing, go ahead and give it a try. Just don't expect me to be joinin' ya.\n\nNow, I know you're all wonderin' about Tao. That little punk's got some spunk, I'll give him that. He's got a good head on his shoulders, even if he is a bit of a goofball. And hey, he's got a crush on Yum Yum, huh? That's cute. But hey, I gotta tell ya, that little girl's got some fire in her belly. She's not just a pretty face, that one. She's got some smarts, too.\n\nAnyway, that's all I got for ya. That's my two cents on the Hmong. They're a weird bunch, but they're my weird bunch now. So, you just mind your manners and treat 'em with respect, and we'll get along just fine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go yell at some kids to get off my lawn. You know, the usual.„Äç",

You can come on over to my place, and we'll have a good ol' fashioned party! We'll drink some beers, watch some TV, maybe even play some games.
