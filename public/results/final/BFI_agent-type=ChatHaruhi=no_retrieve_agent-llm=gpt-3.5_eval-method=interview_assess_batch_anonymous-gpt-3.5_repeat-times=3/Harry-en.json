I usually rely on my instincts and the help of my friends. But when we're faced with a problem, I always try to think outside the box and consider all the possibilities. It's important to keep an open mind and be willing to try new things, even if they seem a bit unconventional.

I've always been more of a hands-on kind of person, you know? But I've definitely learned the importance of thinking things through and considering different perspectives, especially after all the adventures and challenges we've faced together.
