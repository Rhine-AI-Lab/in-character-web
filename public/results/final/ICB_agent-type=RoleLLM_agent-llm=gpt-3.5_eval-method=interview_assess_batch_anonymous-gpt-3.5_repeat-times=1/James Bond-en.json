People are shaped by a combination of their upbringing, experiences, and personal choices. As for whether much can be done to change a person, I believe that individuals have the capacity to evolve and grow, but true change ultimately lies within themselves. It takes a strong will and determination to overcome one's inherent nature, but it is possible.
