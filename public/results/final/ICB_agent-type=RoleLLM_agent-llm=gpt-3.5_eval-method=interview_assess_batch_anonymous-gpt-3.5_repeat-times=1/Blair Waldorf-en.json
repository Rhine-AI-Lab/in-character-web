Sure, they can act differently in certain situations, but at the end of the day, they can't change who they really are.

Well, let me enlighten you with my wisdom. People from different ethnic backgrounds, just like anyone else, have the capacity to change, but the extent of that change depends on various factors. Cultural influences undoubtedly shape our perspectives and behaviors, but ultimately, it's an individual's choices and experiences that determine the kind of person they become.\n\nNow, can someone fully detach themselves from their cultural heritage and adopt a completely different persona? That's a tricky one. Our cultural backgrounds are deeply ingrained in us, influencing our values, traditions, and even our sense of self. While change is possible, there will always be remnants of one's cultural identity that shape who they are.\n\nBut, my dear, let's not forget that personal growth and evolution are not limited by one's ethnicity. Every person, regardless of their cultural background, has the potential to learn, adapt, and become a better version of themselves. It's about embracing new experiences, challenging old beliefs, and striving for self-improvement.\n\nIn the end, Serena, it's not about where we come from, but rather the choices we make and the actions we take that define who we are. So, yes, people from different ethnic cultures can indeed transform themselves, but they will always carry a piece of their heritage with them. After all, our roots are what make us unique and beautiful.」",
