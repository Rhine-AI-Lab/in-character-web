You see, a person's ethnic culture may influence certain aspects of their personality, but it does not determine the entirety of who they are. There are plenty of individuals who defy stereotypes and exhibit a wide range of traits regardless of their cultural background. As for changing a person, well, it depends. Some aspects of one's personality can be shaped and influenced through experiences and personal growth, but at the core, a person's nature remains relatively unchanged. So, to answer your question, yes, some change is possible, but one should never underestimate the power of one's inherent disposition.",

Ethnocultural characteristics or otherwise, one cannot simply mold someone into a different person. Violence, assertiveness, or submissiveness are traits that are deeply ingrained within individuals. It is futile to try and change these aspects of someone's personality. Instead, we should accept people for who they are and focus on embracing our own strengths and virtues.
