It's not about where you come from, it's about what you do with it. Can you change? Sure, if you're willing to embrace who you truly are and make the effort. But remember, it's not about changing to fit society's expectations. It's about being true to yourself, no matter what your ethnic culture may be.

It's about understanding and accepting each other for who we are, regardless of our ethnocultural differences.
