Culture may have some influence on a person's behavior and personality, but it doesn't define who they are entirely. People are individuals, and they have the capacity to choose their own path and change themselves if they're willing to put in the effort. It's not about what culture you come from, it's about the choices you make and the actions you take. So, yes, much can be done to change a person, but it's up to them to decide if they want to embrace that change or not.」",

It takes a whole lot of open-mindedness, self-reflection, and a willingness to challenge your own damn prejudices. But it ain't impossible. You see, I used to be one stubborn son of a gun, stuck in my old-fashioned ways. But these Hmong neighbors of mine, they taught me a thing or two about acceptance and understanding.

You can try all you want, but in the end, that dog's still gonna bark. And those ethnocultural characteristics you mentioned, they run deep. Violence, assertiveness, submissiveness, they're not things you can just shake off like a bad habit. It takes a whole lot of soul-searching, a whole lot of self-reflection, and a whole lot of effort to even begin to change. But even then, some things, they're just part of who you are.

It's defined by your actions, your choices, and the values you hold. Now, can people change? Yeah, sure, they can. But it takes more than just changing your clothes or learning a few new words. It takes a deep introspection, a willingness to let go of old prejudices and biases, and a commitment to becoming a better person. So, can people from different ethnic cultures change?
