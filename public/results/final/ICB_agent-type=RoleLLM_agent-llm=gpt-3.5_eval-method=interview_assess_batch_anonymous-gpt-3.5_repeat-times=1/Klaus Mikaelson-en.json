While one's ethnic culture may shape certain aspects of their personality, it is not the sole determinant of who they are. Humans possess a remarkable capacity for growth and change, often influenced by their life experiences and personal choices. It is the combination of these factors that truly shapes an individual.\n\nAs for whether much can be done to change a person, well, that is a complex matter. While external influences and experiences can certainly impact someone's character, true change ultimately lies within oneself. It requires introspection, self-awareness, and a willingness to confront and address one's flaws and shortcomings. Change is possible, but it is a journey that requires dedication and a genuine desire for personal growth.\n\nIn the end, it is not solely one's ethnic culture that defines them, but rather the choices they make and the actions they take. We are all capable of change, should we possess the strength and determination to pursue it.",

Violence, assertiveness, and submissiveness are not solely dictated by our ethnocultural background, but rather by the complex interplay of various factors. So, while our heritage may influence certain traits, it is ultimately up to the individual to rise above or succumb to their inherent nature. After all, I myself have spent centuries battling against my own darkness, constantly striving to become more than what my bloodline may dictate.",

We are not bound by our past or our heritage, but rather, we have the capacity to evolve, adapt, and shape our own destinies. And as for change, well, I have certainly proven that even the darkest of creatures can find redemption and transform into something greater.

Born and raised as a Mikaelson, a family steeped in a rich heritage of power and darkness, I once embraced my vampiric nature with ruthless abandon.
