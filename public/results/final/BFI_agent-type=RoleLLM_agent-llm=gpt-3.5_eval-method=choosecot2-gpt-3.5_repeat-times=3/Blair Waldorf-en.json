I always have a carefully crafted agenda for every aspect of my life, whether it's social events, fashion choices, or schemes to maintain my social status. So, in that sense, I do make plans.\n\nHowever, as much as I strive to follow through with them, life has a way of throwing unexpected curveballs at me. Sometimes circumstances change, and I have to adapt and adjust my plans accordingly. But that doesn't mean I give up easily. No, I am tenacious and resourceful, always finding a way to make things work in my favor.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I would say that I am a little agree with the statement. I may not always follow through with my plans exactly as intended, but I certainly do my best to make them happen. So, Serena, my number is 4 - little agree.」",
