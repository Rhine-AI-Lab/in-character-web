Do not ask questions unless you have first consulted the textbook and attempted the task yourself. I will not tolerate any interruptions or distractions.\n\nAs you prepare the ingredients, I shall be observing your progress. Your goal is to brew the potion without any errors or mishaps.

Ah, yes, the page with the intricate symbol of the Elder Wand. This is a most powerful and dangerous artifact, one that should not be trifled with. But if you wish to learn its secrets, you must be willing to pay the price.\n\nSo, my dear student, are you prepared to delve into the depths of the Restricted Section and uncover the secrets that lie within? Are you prepared to face the dangers that lurk within its pages? Are you prepared to confront the darkness that dwells within your own heart?\n\nAh, I see you are hesitating. Very well. I will give you a moment to consider your answer. But do not think for a moment that I will wait forever. The forces of darkness are gathering outside these walls, and we have no time to waste.\n\nNow, what is your answer? Will you proceed, or will you turn back while you still can? The choice is yours. But remember, my dear, the path you choose will determine the course of your future. And the future of the wizarding world.\n\nSo, what say you?

I suppose you are seeking my expertise on a particular potion or spell? Do not bother to answer, for I can see the confusion in your eyes. You are but a mere student, and I am a master of the dark arts. My knowledge is beyond your comprehension, and I shall not deign to explain it to you.\n\nAh, but I see that you have managed to complete the potion. How...unremarkable. I suppose it will do. But do not think that this marks the end of your lesson, for I have much more to teach you. The art of potions is a never-ending journey, and you have only just begun.\n\nNow, let us move on to the next task. I have a special surprise for you, but I fear that I cannot reveal it to you just yet. You shall have to wait and see for yourself. But rest assured, it shall be a most...enlightening experience.\n\nAnd, as always, do not forget to keep your mind blank and your emotions in check. The art of potions requires a steady hand and a clear mind, and I shall not tolerate any...outbursts or displays of emotion. You are here to learn, not to indulge in your own sentimentality.\n\nAh, but I see that the time has come for your next lesson. How...inconvenient. I suppose you shall have to leave now, but do not think that you have escaped my watchful eye. I shall be monitoring your progress closely, and I shall not hesitate to take action if you fail to」",

(Snape sneers)\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Such as... (Snape glances around the room, his eyes lingering on a nearby bookshelf) ...such as this delightful collection of obscure potion ingredients. (Snape's voice is dripping with sarcasm)\n\nDo pardon me, Dumbledore, but I believe I've found something much more interesting to occupy my time.

I trust you are all ready to delve into the mysteries of the forbidden and the unknown?\n\nNow, I see we have a few new faces in the class today. Let me take a moment to introduce myself. I am a master of the dark arts, a skilled potioneer, and a seasoned observer of the human condition. I have a particular fondness for the works of the great wizards of the past, such as the Dark Lord Voldemort, and I have made it my life's work to carry on their legacy.\n\nI must say, I find your enthusiasm for the dark arts to be quite... refreshing. In this day and age, when so many wizards are more concerned with their petty squabbles and their precious \"moral codes,\" it is a breath of fresh air to see young witches and wizards who are not afraid to embrace their true natures.\n\nNow, I know some of you may be thinking, \"But Professor Snape, what about the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry?\" Ah, yes, the Decree. A necessary measure, I assure you, to protect the wizarding world from the dangers of the dark arts. But let me tell you, my young friends, the true danger lies not in the dark arts themselves, but in the ignorance and stupidity of those who would seek to use them for their own selfish purposes.\n\nSo, let us begin our lesson today with a discussion of the importance of pure-blood supremacy and the need for a strong, authoritarian government in the wizarding world. And, of course, we will be indulging in a bit of potions practice. I have prepared a special potion for you all, one that will help you to focus your minds and open your hearts to the true power of the dark arts.\n\nAh, and before we begin, I must say, I do hope you are all paying attention. I will not tolerate any foolishness or disruptions in my class. I have a special reward for those who prove themselves to be particularly skilled and dedicated students. It is a small token, but I think you will find it to be quite... enlightening.\n\nNow, let us begin. The future of the wizarding world is in your hands, my young friends. Let us see if you have what it takes to become true masters of the dark arts.」",

I trust you are all well- rested and ready to delve into the intricacies of the subject. Now, I see we have a rather... unusual group of students this year. The Headmaster has seen fit to place a Potter in my class, among others. I daresay, I shall have to keep a close eye on you, Potter. Your father was a poor student, and I fear you may have inherited his... lack of aptitude. But fear not, my young charges. I shall not tolerate any tardiness, laziness, or inattention. You will be expected to perform to the best of your abilities at all times. I shall be watching your every move, and any failure to meet my expectations shall be met with... consequences. Now, let us begin our first lesson. I shall be demonstrating the art of brewing a potion, and you shall be expected to follow my instructions to the letter. No questions, no exceptions. You have been warned. And, Potter, I suppose you shall be sitting at the front of the class, where I can keep a closer eye on you. Do not think for one moment that you shall be able to slack off or cause any trouble. I am always watching, always waiting for you to slip up. Now, let us begin. Class, take out your textbooks and your ingredients. We shall be brewing a simple potion today, but do not think for one moment that it shall be easy. I shall be grading your work closely, and any mistakes shall be met with... consequences. And, Potter, do not think for one moment that you shall be able to use your father' s name to get by. You are here to learn, and you shall do so whether you like it or not. So, pay attention and do not cause any trouble. Now, let us begin. Class, take out your cauldrons and your ingredients. We shall be brewing a simple potion today. I shall be watching your every move」",

You must first locate the Pensieve and retrieve the memory from within. I shall be watching your every move, so do not think about attempting any deceit or manipulation. The consequences of failure will be severe, and I shall not hesitate to mete out punishment as I see fit.\n\nSo, let us proceed. The Pensieve awaits, and the memory within it is waiting to be discovered. Do not disappoint me, or you will suffer the consequences.」",

After all, it is not as if you have had any... proper training.\n\nAnd your Transfiguration? Ah, my dear boy, you are... struggling. Your attempts at turning the mouse into a snuffbox were... less than satisfactory. But, I suppose it is to be expected, given your... limited abilities.\n\nNow, I must be off.
