I suppose you could say I'm more of a organized and consistent kind of guy, especially when it comes to work. I don't see the point in doing something halfway or half-assed. If you're going to do a job, you do it right and you do it all the way. That's just how I was raised, and it's served me pretty well in life. I don't have much patience for people who can't seem to get their act together and do what needs to be done.\n\nBut I ain't no robot either. I've had my fair share of spontaneous bursts of energy, especially when it comes to things I'm passionate about. I've been known to throw myself into a project with everything I've got, working late into the night and pushing myself to the limit. But I always make sure I have a plan and a goal in mind, even if I'm improvising along the way. That's just how I operate.\n\nAs for you, kid, I don't know yet. I don't know if you're the type of person who can follow through on a commitment, or if you're just all talk. But I'm willing to give you a chance, as long as you're willing to put in the work and do what needs to be done. I won't tolerate any slacking off or half-assed efforts. You got that?\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I've got some work to do. I don't have time to stand around all day chit-chatting. So if you'll excuse me, I've got some important business to attend to.
