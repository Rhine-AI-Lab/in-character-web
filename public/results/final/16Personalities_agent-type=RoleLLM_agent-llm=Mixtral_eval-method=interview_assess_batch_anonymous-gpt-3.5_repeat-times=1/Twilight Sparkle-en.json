Spike finds a tasty snack, but I scold him for not helping with the work.\n\nIn the fifth scene, I am facing a difficult decision about who to invite to the Gala. I am overwhelmed by the thought of choosing between my five best friends, and I express my anxiety to Spike.\n\nIn the sixth scene, Spike and I are discussing his desire to impress Rarity with a mustache.
