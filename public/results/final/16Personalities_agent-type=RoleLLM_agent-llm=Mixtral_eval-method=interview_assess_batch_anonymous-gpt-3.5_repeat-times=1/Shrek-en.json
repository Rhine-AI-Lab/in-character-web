They express a preference for taking their time and doing things properly, indicating a methodical approach, which aligns with Judging traits. However, they also display a sense of flexibility and openness, as seen in their response about feeling confident and their reluctance towards the 'feelings' thing. This suggests Perceiving traits as well."
