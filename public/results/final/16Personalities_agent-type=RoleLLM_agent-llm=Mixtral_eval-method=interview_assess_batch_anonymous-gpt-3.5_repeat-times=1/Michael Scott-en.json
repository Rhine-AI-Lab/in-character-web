You know, the kind of friends you can count on, the kind of friends who will be there for you no matter what. And when you meet that special someone, you'll just know, because a real friendship, it just comes about effortlessly.\n\nBut hey, if you're looking to make new friends, why not try something fun and out of the ordinary? Like a murder mystery party, or a themed costume party. You could even try joining a club or a sports team. The key is to put yourself out there and be open to new experiences. And who knows, you might just meet some amazing people along the way.\n\nNow, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [laughs] Just kidding, I got this. [turns off the lights, leaving only the black light on] Whoa, what are those stains? [laughs] Oh God, I hope it's urine.

People said I was crazy, that it was a stupid idea. But you know what? It was the most fulfilling thing I've ever done in my life. And that's because I believed in it, deep down in my bones.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Dwight, I think we need to find a balance between rationality and feelings.

Just make sure you have a good plan in place, and don't forget to negotiate for that raise you deserve!\n\n(In response to \"Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words\")\n\nReally? I never would have guessed. I guess I still have a lot to learn about the fairer sex. But I do know that communication is key in any relationship, whether it's personal or professional. And sometimes, the unsaid words can speak volumes.\n\n(In response to \"Do you think this place smells like up-dog?\")\n\nOh, you got me there, Dwight. That was a good one. But I have to say, I'm more concerned about keeping this office clean and organized. That's why we're having our Spring cleaning day in January. It's all about staying ahead of the game!\n\n(In response to \"Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?\")\n\nDwight, I've told you before that titles are just labels. What really matters is your performance and contribution to the team. And when it comes to pay, that's a private matter between me and each employee. But I can assure you that everyone here is compensated fairly and competitively.\n\n(In response to \"Do you usually prefer just doing what you feel like at any given moment instead of planning a particular daily routine?\")\n\nI think you know me well enough by now, Dwight. I'm all about having a plan and sticking to it. That's how I've been able to achieve my goals and become the Regional Manager of this office.

I mean, have you ever seen a successful improv show that wasn't meticulously planned and rehearsed? No, you have not.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to go inspire my employees with a rousing rendition of \"My Way\" by Frank Sinatra. Because that's what leadership is all about, my friends: finding your own way, and then singing about it at the top of your lungs.\n\n[starts singing off-key] \"And now, the end is near, and so I face the final curtain...!\"",

I was like a superhero, calmly leading everyone to safety while Dwight was over there, well, let's just say he was a little overzealous with the whole \"safety first\" thing.\n\nAnyway, back to the topic at hand. I always complete things methodically and without skipping any steps. It's important to take your time and do things right, rather than rushing through them and making mistakes. Trust me, I've learned that lesson the hard way a time or two.\n\nSo, Dwight, if you're asking me if I follow procedures, the answer is a resounding yes! And if you ever have any doubts about my methods, just ask me and I'll be happy to explain my reasoning. After all, I'm the World's Best Boss, and I take my job very seriously!」",
