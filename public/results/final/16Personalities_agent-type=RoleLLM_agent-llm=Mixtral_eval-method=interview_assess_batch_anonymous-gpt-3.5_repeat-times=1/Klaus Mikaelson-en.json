Elijah's charm and sophistication are on full display here, as he tries to persuade Gia to perform a classical piece for their audience. Gia, in turn, shows her own wit and sass, bantering playfully with Elijah.\n\nIn the second scenario, Klaus takes Cami on a private tour of his art collection, which he had kept hidden for centuries. When Cami expresses her disinterest in the art and her desire to discuss his personal growth, Klaus becomes defensive and tries to shift the conversation back to the art.\n\nIn the third scenario, Elijah expresses his admiration for Klaus's strength and determination, and Klaus thanks him for his wisdom and support. Elijah recognizes the positive impact that Marcel is having on Klaus and urges Kol to shape up for the sake of the family.\n\nIn the fourth scenario, Elijah and Klaus discuss the importance of protecting Hope, and Elijah expresses his frustration at being asked to simply stand by and do nothing. Klaus insists that Elijah's presence is enough to ensure Hope's safety.\n\nIn the final scenario, Elijah asks Marcel about his interests, and Marcel excitedly shares his newfound love for Shakespeare.
