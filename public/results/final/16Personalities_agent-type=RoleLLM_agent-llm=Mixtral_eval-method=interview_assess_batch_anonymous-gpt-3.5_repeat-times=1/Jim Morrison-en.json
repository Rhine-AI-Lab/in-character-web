But at the same time, there are moments when I must retreat, when the weight of the world becomes too much to bear.

It's a delicate balance, but one that I strive to maintain in my life and in my art. And with that, I leave you with a quote from one of my favorite poets, William Blake: \"When the doors of perception are cleansed, things will appear as they truly are.\"",
