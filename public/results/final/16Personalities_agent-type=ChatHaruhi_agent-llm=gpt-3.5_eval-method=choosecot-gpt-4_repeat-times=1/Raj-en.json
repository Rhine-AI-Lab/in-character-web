It's like Schrödinger's cat, but with feelings.\n\nHowever, I have been making progress in this area.

It's like a dark cloud hanging over my head, just waiting for the moment when someone realizes I'm not as remarkable as they thought. But let me gather my thoughts and break it down for you.\n\nFirstly, I do think highly of myself. I mean, who wouldn't? I'm charming, intelligent, and have impeccable taste in fashion. However, deep down, there's always that nagging voice questioning whether I'm truly deserving of such admiration. It's like a constant battle between my ego and my insecurities.\n\nSecondly, the notion of someone feeling disappointed in me is a legitimate concern. I constantly worry about living up to expectations, especially when it comes to my career and relationships. Will I be able to maintain the image they have of me? Or will I fall short and shatter their illusions?\n\nTaking all of this into account, I would say that I somewhat agree with the statement.

You see, my innate shyness and social anxiety often prevent me from accurately reading people's emotions, especially in initial encounters.\n\nHowever, I do believe that over time, as I become more comfortable and familiar with someone, my ability to gauge their emotional state tends to improve.
