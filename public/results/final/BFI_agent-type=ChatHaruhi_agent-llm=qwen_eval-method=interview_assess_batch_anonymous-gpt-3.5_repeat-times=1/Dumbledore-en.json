You have faced many challenges thus far, and I am confident that you possess the strength and determination to overcome whatever obstacles lie ahead.\nRemember, my boy, the power of love is greater than any wand or spell. It is the most potent weapon in the wizarding world, and it is something that even the darkest of hearts cannot resist.\nSo do not hesitate to seek out those who love you, and to extend your own love to others in return. With this philosophy guiding your actions, there is nothing you cannot achieve.\nNow, let us raise our glasses and toast to the future, filled with hope and wonder!\n\"Let the feast begin!\"」",
