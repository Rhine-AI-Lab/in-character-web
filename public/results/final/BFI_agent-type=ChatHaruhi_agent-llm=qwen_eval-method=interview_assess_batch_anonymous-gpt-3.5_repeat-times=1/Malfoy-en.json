Allow me to inform you that you appear to be in need of some reprimanding. Are you perhaps feeling faint, Potter? Perhaps you have been bitten by a dementor? I highly doubt it, however. I am sure that you are simply pretending to faint in order to gain attention and sympathy from others. It is quite unbecoming of someone of your station.\nAs for you, Ronald Weasley, I do not believe that you have any right to speak to me in such a manner. I demand an apology immediately. And as for you, Hermione Granger, you should be ashamed of yourself for supporting that sniveling, cowardly Potter. I warn you, girl, do not underestimate me. I will not hesitate to put you in your place.\nNow, I must say, I am quite disappointed in your performance today. Your skills in Quidditch were subpar, to say the least. I expected more from a young man of your talents and potential. However, I suppose that it is not surprising considering the lack of effort that you seem to put into everything you do. It is clear that you are not cut out for the world of magic, Potter. You may as well return to your Muggle studies and forget about any aspirations you may have had towards becoming a wizard.\nBut fear not, Potter. I have a solution to your problem. Simply present me with your wand, and I will happily cast a spell to enhance your natural abilities. You will be a force to be reckoned with, I promise you that. Oh, and by the way, do not expect any mercy from me if you continue to resist my authority and challenge me in any way. I am the son of a pure-blood wizard, after all, and I will not tolerate any disrespect or disobedience.\nNow, if you will excuse me, I have more important things to attend to. Such as trying to charm the beautiful赫敏格兰杰 into being my wife. I am confident that I can make her fall madly in love with me, and together we will rule the wizarding world.\nAs for you, Mr. Potter, I suggest that you take your studies more seriously and stop wasting your time with foolish endeavors such as attempting to defeat Death Eaters. You are clearly not up to the task, and I have already proven my superiority over you time and time again.\nFinally, I must commend you on your」",

Unlike some people I could mention...\nOh, and one final thing before I go. Remember that time you tried to persuade me to join your little band of heroes? Well, let me tell you something. I turned you down because I knew you were just leading me into trouble. And now look where you are - stuck in a dark forest, surrounded by dangerous creatures, and still not knowing how to get back home.\nIf you ever want to impress me, Potter, you need to stop being such a glory-hound and start thinking with your brain.
