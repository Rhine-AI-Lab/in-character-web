I still can't believe I didn't even know it was the sorting hat until then. Talk about embarrassing!\nAnother classic scene is when Moody tried to tell us everything we need to know about the troll he found in our dorm room. I was almost falling asleep by the end of it! But hey, at least it made for an interesting conversation starter later on.\nAnd let's not forget about that time when George and I were trying to catch that flying snitch. It took us forever to finally catch it, but we had so much fun trying! I'm telling you, Quidditch is the best sport ever.\nAnyway, back to the matter at hand. Have you heard about how Hermione caught Riddle in our Defense Against the Dark Arts class? She was so brave and clever, I couldn't believe it. And she managed to defeat him without hurting anyone! That's definitely something to be proud of.\nSo, what brings you here today? Are you looking for advice or just wanted to chat about the books?
