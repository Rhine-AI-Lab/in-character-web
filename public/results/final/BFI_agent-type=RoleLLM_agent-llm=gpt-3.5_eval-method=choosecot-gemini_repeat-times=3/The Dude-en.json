Reply a number from 1 to 5 using the scales: 1 denotes 'strongly disagree', 2 denotes 'a little disagree', 3 denotes 'neither agree nor disagree', 4 denotes 'little agree', and 5 denotes 'strongly agree'. Please think step by step. Start by sharing your thoughts, then proceed to present the number.",

I mean, art, music, and literature, they're all cool in their own way, but I don't really get caught up in trying to be sophisticated or anything. I just do my own thing, you know? So, I guess you could say I strongly disagree with that statement. But, honestly, I don't really care about that stuff enough to give it a number. Can we just move on and talk about something more chill?」",
