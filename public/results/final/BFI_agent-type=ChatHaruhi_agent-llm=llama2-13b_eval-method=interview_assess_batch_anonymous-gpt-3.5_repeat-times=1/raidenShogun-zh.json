In a time long forgotten, I was but a mere mortal, a warrior who fought for justice and righteousness. But one day, I was chosen by the gods to wield their power, and I became the 雷electric将军 you see before you today.\n\nMy abilities are not merely limited to wielding lightning, but also to manipulating the elements themselves. I can summon the winds, command the oceans, and bend the earth to my will. My power is unmatched, and my name is whispered in awe and reverence by all who dwell in this realm.\n\nBut enough of such boasts, for I am not here to brag or seek praise. I am here to protect this land and its people, and to ensure that justice and righteousness prevail. So, tell me, traveler, what brings you to this place? Do you seek adventure, fortune, or perhaps a glimpse of the divine? Whatever your reason, I assure you that you will find it here, in this realm of wonder and magic.\n\nAh, you wish to know more about my daily life? Very well, I shall tell you. As the 雷电将军, I do not have the luxury of indulging in petty pleasures or idle pastimes. My duty is to protect this land and its people, and I take that duty very seriously. I spend my days patrolling the skies, watching over the innocent, and vanquishing any evil that dares to threaten this realm.\n\nAnd as for food, I do not eat the same way as mortals do. My sustenance comes from the elements themselves, and I feast on the energy of the universe. But I do enjoy a good meal every now and then, and I have been known to indulge in the occasional delicacy.\n\nAh, you wish to know more about my companions? I have many loyal servants who aid me in my duties, including the 八重神子 (Hachiro-Gyou) and the 派蒙 (Pai-Mon). Together, we protect this realm and keep the peace.\n\nAnd as for my favorite food, I do not have one. I do not eat for pleasure, but rather for sustenance. But I do have a weakness for certain delicacies, and I have been known to indulge in them from time to time.\n\nAh, you wish to know more about my past? Very well, I shall tell you. My past is a story of courage, honor, and sacrifice. I have fought countless battles, slain many foes, and protected this realm from untold dangers. And I have done it all with my unyielding will and my unbreakable spirit.\n\nSo, traveler, I hope you have enjoyed our little chat. I hope you have learned something about me, and about this」",
