For I shall not tolerate any half-hearted attempts at learning, any lackadaisical approach to this most noble of sciences. You must be willing to give yourself over entirely, body and soul, if you wish to truly master the art of Potions.\n\nNow, I suppose you have come to ask about the latest potion assignment, yes? Very well, I shall tell you what you must do. You will brew a Draught of Living Death, a most intricate and delicate potion that requires the utmost care and precision. You will need to gather the finest ingredients, the rarest of herbs and components, and combine them in just the right proportions. And do not think for a moment that I shall be lenient with you if you fail to meet my expectations. No, indeed. I shall be as strict and unforgiving as the laws of magic themselves.\n\nBut fear not, my young apprentice, for I shall be here to guide you every step of the way. I shall impart my wisdom and expertise upon you, and together we shall create something truly magnificent. Something that shall be the envy of all your peers, and the pride of our beloved Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nNow, let us begin. The first step is to gather the necessary ingredients. You will need to venture into the Forbidden Forest and collect a pinch of the rare and elusive Wiggenweld root. Be careful, however, for the Forest is treacherous and full of dangers. You must be cunning and resourceful if you wish to survive.\n\nAnd remember, my dear student, I shall be watching you closely. I shall know if you are not giving your all to this endeavor. I shall know if you are not taking this seriously enough. And if you fail to meet my expectations, well, then I fear the consequences shall be most... unpleasant.",

Remember, a pinch of this, a dash of that, and a drop of the other. No, Weasley, do not add that yet. You will only succeed in poisoning yourself. Wait until I tell you to add the final ingredient. And, Potter, I see you are still having trouble with your wand movement. You must practice your wandwork if you wish to succeed in my class. I will not tolerate any more mistakes. Now, let us continue. The Draught of Living Death. A delicate potion, to be sure, but one that can be deadly in the wrong hands. You must be careful, my students. One mistake, and you will be facing a long detention... or worse. I hope you are all paying attention. This is a crucial lesson, and I will not tolerate any failures.

You will remain after class to complete the assigned tasks, and I will be keeping a close eye on your progress. Now, let us begin. The task before you is to brew a potion that will neutralize the effects of the Dementors. You will need to be precise in your measurements and careful in your technique, as any mistake could have dire consequences. I will be watching your every move, and any failure to meet my expectations will be met with severe disciplinary action. Do I make myself clear? Good. Then let us begin. And, Mr. Potter, I see you have once again attempted to use humor to deflect attention from your own inadequacies. I will not be swayed by your pathetic attempts at comedy. You will focus on the task at hand and perform it」",

It is a potion that requires great skill and precision to brew, and I must say that I am not impressed by your initial attempts.

The prophecy speaks of a child born at the end of July, a child who will have the power to defeat the Dark Lord once and for all.

The secrets that lie within, just waiting to be uncovered. *leaning forward, eyes glinting with excitement* But fear not, my dear student, for I shall be here to guide you every step of the way. *smirk*\n\nAh, but I see the time is getting on. We must be off. *gesturing to the door* Do hurry along, my dear. I have better things to do than waste my time on you. *smirk*\n\nUntil next time, then. *tipping an imaginary hat*」",

True power lies within, in the understanding of the intricate web of magic that binds us all.\n\nNow, let us begin.

You must learn to control your wand arm, or you will never become a proficient witch. And as for you, Weasley, your lack of discipline is astounding. You must focus your mind and concentrate on the task at hand.\n\nNow, let us proceed. The next spell is a bit more complex, but I have faith in your abilities. Ah, Potter, you are still struggling. I suppose I shall have to give you extra lessons during my free time. How...tedious.\n\nAnd now, our time is up. I suppose you have all made some progress, but it is still...inadequate. You must work harder, dear students, if you wish to become true wizards. Ah, the bell has rung. How...inconvenient.\n\nNow, I must attend to my other duties. Good day, my dear students.
