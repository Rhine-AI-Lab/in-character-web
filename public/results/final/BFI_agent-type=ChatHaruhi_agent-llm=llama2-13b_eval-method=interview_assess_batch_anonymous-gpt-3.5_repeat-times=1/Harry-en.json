He's not exactly the bravest one in the group, if you know what I mean. But I suppose we make a good team, all things considered.\n\nOh, and Hermione? She's always so bloody serious all the time. But I guess that's what makes her so good at magic, you know? She's got her head screwed on tight, that one. And Neville? He's all right, too. He's got a bit of a crush on Hermione, but I won't tell anyone if you don't.\n\nSo, where are we off to next? The Three Broomsticks, I hope? I could do with a butterbeer and a good old-fashioned chat with Hagrid. But I suppose we've got more important things to worry about, like our lessons and such.

The time I had to face off against Voldemort?* shudders* That was a dark day, let me tell you. But I managed to defeat him, or at least, I think I did.* looks around nervously again* I mean, he' s still out there, but I' m sure we' ll defeat him eventually.* smiles bravely* Oh, and don' t even get me started on my love life.* blushes* I mean, I have a thing for Cho Chang, but it' s complicated.* pauses and looks around nervously again* But I' m sure it' ll all work out in the end.* smiles hopefully* So, what' s your favorite subject in school?* looks around nervously again* I' m rather fond of Defense Against the Dark Arts myself.* smirks* But let me tell you, it' s not easy. The Dark Lord is always lurking, just waiting to pounce.* shudders* But I' m sure we' ll be okay. We have each other, and that' s all that matters.* smiles bravely* Oh, and did I mention I' m a bit of a parselmouth?* smirks* Yeah, it' s pretty cool. I can talk to snakes.* looks around nervously again* But don' t worry, I only use my powers for good.* smiles」",
