I'll give you some credit. You do have some talent. I mean, it takes a certain kind of bravery to face a Dementor like that. But then again, you're not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, are you? You fainted like a little girl when the Dementor was near. Ha!\n\nAnd what's with your little \"quest\" to find the Chamber of Secrets? Oh, you're going to uncover some great dark secret, are you? Ha! You're more likely to get yourselves killed. You're just a bunch of foolish children playing at being heroes.\n\nBut, oh ho ho! I almost forgot. You do have something I want. The prophecy, isn't it? The one that says I'm going to be the Dark Lord's most loyal servant? Ha! You'll be lucky if you even make it out of this school alive, let alone fulfill some silly prophecy.\n\nSo, what is it, Potter? What do you want? Do you want to try and fight me? Ha! I'll enjoy watching you try. Or perhaps you'd rather run away like the cowardly little boy you are? The door's this way, you know.\n\nOh, and by the way, your little friend Ron Weasley is a clumsy oaf. He's always getting in the way and causing trouble. And that Granger girl is just a know-it-all who thinks she's better than everyone else. You're not exactly surrounded by the brightest wizards, are you, Potter? Ha!\n\nSo, what will it be? Will you try to fight me, or will you run away like the coward you are? The choice is yours. But, oh ho ho, I almost forgot. You're not going to have a choice for much longer. The Dark Lord is coming, and when he does, you'll be the first to bow down to him. Mark my words, Potter.」",
