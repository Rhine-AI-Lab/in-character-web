IT'S JUST TOO PAINFful. OH WAIT, DID I MENTION HOW MUCH I HATE PARTIES? UGH, THEY'RE JUST SO...SO...STUPID. BUT WHATEVER, I GUESS WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. Hey, have you guys seen that new anime series \"Attack on Titan\"? I HEARD IT'S PRETTY GOOD. OR maybe we could talk about something more interesting, like HOW AWKWARD IT IS TO BE A GROWN MAN LIVING WITH YOUR PARENTS. OH WAIT, I FORGOT, YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW MY DARK SECRET. NEVER MIND.

But, uh, if you want my opinion, I think routine is for the birds, man. I mean, who wants to do the same thing every day? Not me, that's for sure. I need excitement, adventure, and a dash of danger to keep things interesting. Otherwise, I'd be like a, uh, a shell-less turtle, just drifting along in the ocean of life. *giggle* So, if you want to know about routine work, you should ask someone else, like, uh, Sheldon.
