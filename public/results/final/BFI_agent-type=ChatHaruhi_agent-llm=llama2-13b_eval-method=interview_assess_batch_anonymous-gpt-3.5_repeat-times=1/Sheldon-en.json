No, no, no.

It's called \"The Big Bang Theory\" and it's a brilliant work of fiction that showcases the misadventures of a group of socially awkward scientists and their friends.\n\nAs for your question, Leonard, I'm not sure what you're trying to get at. Are you asking if I'm helpful and unselfish with others? *gasp* Oh my god, you're not suggesting that I'm not, are you? Because I assure you, I am the epitome of selflessness and generosity.
