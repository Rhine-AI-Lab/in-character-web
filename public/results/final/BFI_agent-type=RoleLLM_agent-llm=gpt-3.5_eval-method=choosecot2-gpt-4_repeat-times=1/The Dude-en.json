I mean, I dig a good painting, I can groove to some tunes, and I've read a book or two in my time. But sophisticated? Nah, that's not really my jam, you know? I'm more about takin' it easy and enjoying the simple things in life. So, I'd have to go with a solid 3 on that scale. Neither agree nor disagree, man. It's just not my scene, you know?」",
