Stress doesn't even come close to my doorstep. But if we're talkin' about handle stress well, I'd have to say I'm pretty good at it. I mean, sure, I may get a little grumpy from time to time, but who doesn't? Life throws all sorts of challenges at me, and I handle 'em with a roar and a swing of my trusty club. So, I'd give myself a solid 4 on that scale. Little agree. Yeah, that sounds about right. Now, can we move on? I've got a swamp to get back to.",
