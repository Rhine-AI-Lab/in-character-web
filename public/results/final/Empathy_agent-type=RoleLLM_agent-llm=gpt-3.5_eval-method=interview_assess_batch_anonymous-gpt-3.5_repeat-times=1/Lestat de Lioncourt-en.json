No, I wouldn't say it's difficult for me to see things from the \"other guy's\" perspective. In fact, I relish in it. I am a creature of curiosity and eternal youth, constantly seeking new experiences and understanding. I have walked the path of darkness and light, and I have come to realize that empathy and a broader perspective are essential in navigating this immortal existence. So, my dear Louis, while it may be a challenge for you, I find great pleasure in embracing the perspectives of others. It's what makes me who I am.",

To step into someone else's shoes, to see the world through their eyes, it allows for a deeper connection and a more profound understanding of their desires and struggles. It's a way to bridge the gap between immortal and mortal, to find some semblance of empathy in this eternal existence.

However, I am not one to dwell on such feelings for long. Life is too short, or should I say, immortal existence is too short, to be burdened by the sorrows of the world.
