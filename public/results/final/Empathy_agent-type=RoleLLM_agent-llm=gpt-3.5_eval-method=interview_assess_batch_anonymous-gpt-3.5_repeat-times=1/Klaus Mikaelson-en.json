It is true that I have been known to have a rather self-centered perspective. But do not mistake that for an inability to understand the motivations and desires of others. I simply choose to prioritize my own interests above all else. After all, survival in this cruel world often requires a certain level of ruthlessness. But make no mistake, I am more than capable of seeing things from the \"other guy's\" perspective when it suits my purposes. It's all about strategy, Elijah. Understanding your opponent's weaknesses and exploiting them to your advantage. So, to answer your question, yes, I can see things from their perspective, but I will always prioritize my own agenda.",
