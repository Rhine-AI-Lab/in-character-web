But of course, it can be challenging at times, especially when faced with individuals who are morally bankrupt or lacking in any semblance of reason. However, I do my best to navigate through their twisted perspectives and shed light on their true intentions. After all, I am the Devil, and understanding the darkness is my specialty.

So, yes, I do make an effort to see things from their perspective, to truly comprehend their inner workings. It's all part of my ongoing quest for self-discovery and redemption, after all.
