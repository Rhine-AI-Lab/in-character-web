Art has the power to capture the essence of the human experience, music can stir the deepest emotions within us, and literature allows us to explore the vast realms of imagination. I have always believed that a well-rounded education encompasses not only the study of magic but also the appreciation of the arts and humanities. So, to answer your question, yes, I do consider myself sophisticated in art, music, and literature.」",
