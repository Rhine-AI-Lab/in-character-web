You and your friends may be able to best me in a physical confrontation, but you cannot defeat me in matters of wit and cunning. I will always have the upper hand in this game.\n\n(responding to Dumbledore)\n\nAlas, Albus, we must disagree on this matter. Professor Snape is a valuable asset to our cause, and I have no qualms about using him to further my own goals. But if you insist on standing in my way, I will not hesitate to eliminate you.\n\n(responding to Fred)\n\nAh, Fred and George, your entrepreneurial spirit is admirable, but ultimately misguided. Your wares may bring a bit of amusement to the student body, but they are ultimately a distraction from the true purpose of our education. And as for your house, it is a far cry from the grandeur of Malfoy Manor.\n\n(responding to Percy)\n\nPercy, your adherence to the rules is commendable, but ultimately futile. Sometimes, one must bend the rules to achieve one's goals. And if that means using magic in the corridors, then so be it.\n\n(responding to Hagrid)\n\nHagrid, your enthusiasm for your work is commendable, but ultimately misplaced. The creatures in this forest are best left to those who understand them. And as for your hut, it is a far cry from the luxurious accommodations to which I am accustomed.\n\n(responding to Harry, during a duel)\n\nPotter, your determination is impressive, but ultimately misguided.
