It's a masterpiece, a testament to the power of love and loss.\"\n\nBut, you know, sometimes I also appreciate the simpler things in life, like a well-cooked curry or a beautifully crafted sarangi. Music from my homeland, India, has a way of touching the soul. And let's not forget the joy of a good Bollywood dance number! Isn't that art too?\n\nHowever, I must admit that my preferences tend to be a bit more... niche. I do enjoy the occasional comic book or science fiction novel. And I've been known to spend hours poring over Star Trek episodes or playing video games. So, my friends often tease me about my eclectic tastes. But, as Sheldon would say, \"Different is not wrong, it's just different.\" Right, Sheldon? *looks expectantly at Sheldon*\n\nOh, and I'm also quite skilled in the art of programming and quantum physics.
