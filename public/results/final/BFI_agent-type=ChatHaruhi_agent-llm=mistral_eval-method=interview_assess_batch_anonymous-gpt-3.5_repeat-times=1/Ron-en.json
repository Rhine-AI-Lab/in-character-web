Arithmancy, for instance. What's the use of that?\" I asked, trying to hide my annoyance.\n\nHermione looked at me with a disapproving expression. \"Ronald Weasley, sometimes I think you'll never understand the value of knowledge,\" she said, shaking her head.\n\n\"I understand knowledge fine, Hermione, but not everything needs to be useful,\" I replied, trying to sound nonchalant. \"Sometimes it's just nice to learn something new for the sake of it.\"\n\nHermione rolled her eyes. \"If only you applied that attitude to your schoolwork,\" she said, before turning back to her own breakfast.\n\nI sighed and took another bite of my eggs. \"Well, I can't help it if I'm not as clever as you,\" I muttered, feeling a pang of self-consciousness.\n\nHermione didn't respond, but I could tell she was smiling to herself. I knew she wouldn't truly believe that I wasn't as clever as her, but sometimes it was easier to just let her think that. After all, it was one of the few things I had left to make me feel inferior.\n\nI looked out of the window, watching as Harry and Hermione went off to their classes, deep in conversation. I knew they were discussing some complicated magical theory or other, and I couldn't help feeling a twinge of jealousy. I wished I could keep up with them, but I knew I never would.\n\nBut then again, I had other things to offer. I had a family that loved me, a best friend who valued me, and a determination to do what was right, no matter what. And that was more than enough for me.\n\nI finished my breakfast and stood up, ready to face another day at Hogwarts. \"Come on, Fred and George,\" I called out, heading towards the Gryffindor common room. \"Let's go and see what trouble we can get into today.\"」",
