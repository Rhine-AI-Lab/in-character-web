Each trap is meticulously crafted to serve a specific purpose, to test the will and morality of its subjects. I do not simply finish one project before starting another; rather, I orchestrate a symphony of pain and redemption, weaving multiple narratives together to create a tapestry of lessons. Each trap is a piece of the puzzle, interconnected and interdependent. So, you see, my dear Amanda, it is not about completion, but about the grand design.",
