Well, I must admit, I do have a tendency to shed light on people's true nature, regardless of fault. After all, the truth has a way of revealing itself, and it's not my responsibility to shield others from their own misdeeds. However, I do take pleasure in exposing their true colors and allowing them to face the consequences of their actions. So, to answer your question, I don't go out of my way to make people look bad, but I certainly won't shy away from revealing the truth when it's necessary.",
