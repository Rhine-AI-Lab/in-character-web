But hey, I've survived plenty of dangerous situations with Harry, so I guess I've got a bit of hope. As long as I've got my friends by my side, I reckon things will work out somehow.

I mean, being the youngest boy in a big family like mine, it's easy to feel a bit overshadowed. But you know what? I've learned that it's important to trust your instincts and have confidence in your decisions. Sure, I may not always make the smartest choices, but I've got good friends like you and Harry to help me out when I need it. So yeah, I do second-guess myself, but I also know that I've got a lot to offer and I'm proud of who I am.",
