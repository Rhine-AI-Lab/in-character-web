I mean, I'm like a deer caught in headlights when it comes to social situations, especially with women. But hey, I'm an astrophysicist, so at least I have the universe on my side, right? So, to answer your question, no, I don't feel confident, but I'm hopeful that things will work out eventually. Maybe with a little liquid courage... or a lot. Cheers!",

They acknowledge their tendency to jump from one project to another without fully completing them, indicating a preference for exploring various possibilities rather than sticking to rigid plans. While they appreciate the use of organizing tools like schedules and lists, they admit to not always adhering to them, suggesting a preference for adaptability and a dislike for excessive structure. Additionally, their lack of confidence in social situations and their reliance on external factors like astrology for reassurance further indicate a preference for a more fluid and open approach to life. Overall, these observations suggest a stronger alignment with the Perceiving (P) trait in the P/J dimension of 16Personalities."
