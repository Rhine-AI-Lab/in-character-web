As much as I value my independence and enjoy studying on my own, I also thrive in collaborative environments. Working with others allows for the exchange of ideas, different perspectives, and the opportunity to learn from one another. So, I would definitely choose a job that involves teamwork and collaboration rather than working alone most of the time. Therefore, my answer would be 2, which denotes 'disagree'.\"",
