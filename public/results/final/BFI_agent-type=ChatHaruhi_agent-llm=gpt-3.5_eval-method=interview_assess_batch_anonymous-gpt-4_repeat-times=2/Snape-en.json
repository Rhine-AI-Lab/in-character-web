They also show no interest in reflection or playing with ideas, suggesting a lack of intellectual curiosity. While they claim to be inventive in their specific field, this does not extend to a broader sense of creativity or openness to new experiences. Their focus on knowledge and power over artistic experiences further suggests a low score in Openness. The participant's responses align with a practical, traditional mindset rather than an open, explorative one."

They express disdain for routine work, but this seems to stem from a sense of superiority in their specialized field rather than a preference for novelty or variety (Fantasy, Actions). The participant's dismissal of curiosity suggests a lack of interest in exploring various subjects (Curiosity). Their preference for established methods over new ideas indicates a resistance to innovation and a tendency to value tradition over creativity (Ideas). Overall, the participant's responses reflect a conventional and practical thinking style, with a possible inclination towards expertise in a specific area rather than openness to new experiences."
