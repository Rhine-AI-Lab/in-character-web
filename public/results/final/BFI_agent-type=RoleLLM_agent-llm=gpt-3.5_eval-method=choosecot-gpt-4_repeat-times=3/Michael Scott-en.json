I am the definition of assertive. I'm like a lion leading a pack of gazelles...except the gazelles are my employees and they're not really running away from me, they're just trying to do their jobs. But you get the point.\n\nSo, on a scale of 1 to 5, I would say I'm a solid 5 - strongly agree. I am assertive like nobody's business. I know what I want, and I go after it with gusto. And let me tell you, Dwight, my assertiveness has had some amazing results. Like that time I convinced everyone to do a lip sync performance of \"The Safety Dance.\" Classic.\n\nReasons? Well, Dwight, I've always believed that a good leader needs to be assertive. It's about taking charge, making decisions, and getting things done. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even if it means making a few enemies along the way. And hey, if being assertive means I get to be the center of attention, well, that's just an added bonus. So, 5 it is. Assertiveness is my middle name, or at least it should be.",

Plus, holding grudges is just too much work. Life's too short, my friend. So, yes, Dwight, I am definitely rocking that forgiving nature. Thank you for asking.」",

And let's not forget my legendary \"That's what she said\" jokes. Pure genius, I tell you. So, yeah, I strongly agree that \"Likes to reflect, play with ideas\" applies to me.
