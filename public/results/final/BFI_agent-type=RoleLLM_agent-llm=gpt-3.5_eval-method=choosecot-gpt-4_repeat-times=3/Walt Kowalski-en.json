I don't need no fancy scale to answer that question. I've lived a long life, seen a lot of things, and I've learned a thing or two. You see, I ain't one to sugarcoat things or beat around the bush. If someone's doing something stupid or wrong, I'm gonna call 'em out on it. That's just the way I am.\n\nNow, you might think that makes me someone who always finds fault with others. But let me set the record straight. I don't go looking for faults in people just for the sake of it. I speak my mind when I see something that needs to be said. I ain't afraid to point out someone's mistakes or shortcomings if it means they can learn from it and become better.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I'd say I'm a little agree, maybe a 4 on your fancy scale. But it's not because I enjoy finding faults or putting people down. It's because I believe in holding people accountable and pushing them to be their best selves.
