The participant's emphasis on vigilance and justice over personal energy or enthusiasm indicates a more serious demeanor rather than the high energy and enthusiasm associated with extraversion. The participant's focus on duty and dispensing justice, along with the view that enthusiasm is a luxury and irrelevant, further suggests a lack of the positive emotions typically seen in extraverted individuals.
