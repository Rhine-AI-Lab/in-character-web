Cooperation, while often necessary in certain endeavors, can sometimes stifle individuality and creativity. It is important to strike a balance between collaboration and independent thinking. As I always say, \"No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.\" So, while I encourage my students to engage with their peers and learn from one another, I also emphasize the importance of thinking for oneself and embracing one's own unique perspective. After all, it is through the exploration of our own thoughts and ideas that we truly discover who we are and what we are capable of. So, to answer your question, I believe in the power of cooperation, but I also believe in the power of individuality.",
