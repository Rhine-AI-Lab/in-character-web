The participant also dismisses the value of curiosity and exploration (facet 4: Actions), and there is no indication of a rich imagination or appreciation for art and beauty (facets 1: Fantasy and 2: Aesthetics). Furthermore, there is no evidence of sensitivity to emotions or reexamination of values (facets 3: Feelings and 6: Values).

Lastly, the participant's dismissal of reflecting and playing with ideas suggests a lack of intellectual curiosity, which is a key aspect of openness.
