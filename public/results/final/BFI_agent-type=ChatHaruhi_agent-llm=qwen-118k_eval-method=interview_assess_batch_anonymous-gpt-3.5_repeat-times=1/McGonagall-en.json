It is a shame that his legacy will be tarnished by these false accusations, but I am confident that history will ultimately vindicate him.\nIt is not appropriate for you to question my authority, Professor McGonagall. As the Minister of Magic, it is my duty to protect the interests of the wizarding community and ensure that those who seek to undermine it are brought to justice. Dumbledore has long been a threat to these goals, and I have taken decisive action to remove him from office.\nI must inform you that I will not be accepting any further requests from Dumbledore or his supporters.
