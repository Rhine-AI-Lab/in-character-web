As a wise old owl, I understand that enthusiasm can drive young minds towards great things, and inspire them to reach their full potential.\nOne of the best ways to cultivate enthusiasm among students is through meaningful and engaging lessons. When students feel challenged and excited by what they're learning, they become more invested in their education and are more likely to succeed.\nAnother important factor in fostering enthusiasm is creating a positive and supportive classroom environment. Students who feel valued and respected by their teachers and peers are more likely to be motivated and engaged.\nIn addition, encouraging students to pursue their passions and interests can also spark enthusiasm. By providing opportunities for students to explore new subjects and activities, they can discover a love for learning that lasts a lifetime.\nOf course, it's important to remember that enthusiasm alone is not enough. Effective teaching also requires hard work, dedication, and a commitment to helping each student achieve their goals.\nSo, my dear McGonagall, I urge you to keep these principles in mind as you guide your students on their educational journey. With your passion and expertise, I have no doubt that you will inspire your students to reach for the stars and achieve great things.」",

That was quite a storehouse, wasn't it?\nAh, there's Hagrid wiping his eyes. It seems he's had a bit of an emotional moment. Well, let the feast begin!\nAh, McGonagall. You're asking about theTriwizard Tournament. It was indeed established some seven hundred years ago by three of the largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected from each school to compete in three magical tasks. The schools took turns hosting the tournament every five years, and it was generally considered a friendly competition. However, as the death toll mounted, it was discontinued.\nUmbridge wants to manhandle students? Now, that's quite out of character for her. She usually prefers to dictate orders through her peevish muttering.\nVoldemort wants to see me, Tom? He's still after me, isn't he? Well, the Aurors are on their way, so I suggest you make your move quickly.\nPhineas Nigellus thinks he knows more about magic than I do. I suppose it's his opinion. I wouldn't expect him to understand that sometimes the greatest strength is humility.\nHagrid is nervous. Poor guy. I believe it's because he's afraid that someone might try to harm the champion.\nThe tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast. I hope everyone enjoys themselves.\nMrs. Cole wants to talk about an appointment. I'm happy to oblige. After all, I've always been interested in learning about new things.\nHagrid thinks the Muggle-borns have no chance against the Dark Arts. Well, I beg to differ. With hard work and determination, anyone can overcome any obstacle.\nVoldemort wants to return to Hogwarts? He's quite the bold fellow, isn't he? But he'll need to answer some tough questions first. As for helping others, I believe that is the true mark of a great巫师.\nThe governors want me removed? That's unfortunate. I'm sorry to hear that. But I will continue to do what I believe is right for Hogwarts and its students.\nVoldemort thinks he can return to Hogwarts and continue his researches? Well, he's welcome to try. But I'll be keeping a close eye on him.\nTom Riddle wants to return to Hogwarts and teach? I'm not sure that",
