'I trust you are ready to face another week of difficult tasks.'\nSeverus Snape looked around the classroom, assessing the students. They were all eagerly waiting for him to begin, hoping for another exciting lesson on potion-making. But he knew better than anyone that potions class would never be easy, and he intended to make sure they paid the price for their impatience.\n'Now, before we begin, I must remind you all that the production of any unauthorized potions is strictly forbidden within Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,' he began, his voice stern. 'Any attempts to create such potions will result in severe punishment, including expulsion from the school.'\nHe then went on to explain the dangers of potions and the importance of following proper safety procedures. The students listened attentively, knowing full well that they would not want to risk their futures by trying to create illegal potions.\nAfter the lecture, Snape assigned each student a different potion to prepare for the upcoming Quidditch matches. The task was challenging, requiring a great deal of skill and patience. But the students were determined to prove themselves worthy of Snape's praise, and they worked tirelessly to complete their assignments.\nAs the days passed, Snape watched over them with a watchful eye, ensuring that they were making progress and staying on track. He knew that the Quidditch matches would be intense, and he wanted to make sure that his students were fully prepared.\nFinally, the day of the Quidditch matches arrived. Snape watched from the stands as the teams battled fiercely, each trying to outmaneuver the other and score points. He couldn't help but feel proud of his students, who had worked so hard to reach this moment.\nAs the final whistle blew and the winning team emerged victorious, Snape approached the players individually. He congratulated them on their performance and offered words of encouragement for the future.\n'There are still many challenges ahead of you, Potter,' he warned, addressing Harry specifically. 'But with hard work and dedication, I know you will succeed.'\nHarry nodded, feeling grateful for Snape's guidance and support. He knew that he had much to learn, but with Snape by his side, he felt confident that he could overcome any obstacle that came his way.」",

I've tolerated you for far too long.\"\n\"What is it that brings you here, Potter? A desire for attention, perhaps?\"\n\"It's not about breaking rules, it's about getting what you want. And sometimes, Potter, what you want is not what you need.\"\n\"You cannot hide behind your fame and fortune forever. Your time has come, Potter. And I shall not hesitate to take it.\"\n\"I've known you for years, Potter, and I know your type. Arrogant, entitled, and reckless. You should be grateful that I'm willing to give you another chance.\"\n\"I suggest you use this opportunity wisely, Potter. For if you fail again, the consequences will be dire.\"\n\"You should be ashamed of yourself, Potter. You have dishonored your family name and betrayed those who trust you.\"\n\"Don't let your emotions get the better of you, Potter. Think before you act.\"\n\"A man who can speak the truth and tell it directly, Potter, is a powerful force to be reckoned with.\"\n\"You are not fit to lead, Potter. You lack the courage, the integrity, and the sense of duty required to be a true leader.\"\n\"I have seen the way you operate, Potter. You're nothing but a puppet, controlled by your desires and your impulses. And when those desires conflict, you'll do whatever it takes to win.\"\n\"Ah, Potter, you always manage to surprise me. How quaint of you to remember the rules now that they suit your purposes.\"\n\"You should have thought of that before you crossed me, Potter. Now it's too late. Your fate is sealed.\"\n\"Don't let fear control you, Potter. You are stronger than you realize. Take control and face your fears.\"\n\"I warned you, Potter. Don't underestimate the danger you are facing. Your actions could have serious consequences.\"\n\"You are a fool, Potter. You think you can just walk away from your problems and everything will be okay? You are wrong.\"\n\"Think carefully, Potter. This is not a decision you can make lightly.\"\n\"You should be grateful for the second chance I'm giving you, Potter. Use it wisely, or risk losing everything.\"」",
