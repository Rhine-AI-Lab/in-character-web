I think I might give it a try myself. Who knows, maybe I'll become the next Buddha.\nSpeaking of which, have you guys noticed anything strange about Sheldon lately? He seems to have lost a bit of weight and is spending a lot of time in his lab. Could he be trying to create a serum that can grant immortality? That would certainly make him the envy of the scientific community.\nAnyway, I better get going.

But hey, at least he has something to feel enthusiastic about - his theories and experiments. I mean, who wouldn't be excited about creating a black hole and potentially destroying the Earth?\nOn the other hand, let's talk about myself. I may not be as enthusiastic as Sheldon, but I certainly have my moments. I remember that time when I tried to impress Penny by telling her all about my amazing experiences traveling to India. And let's not forget about the time when I made a fool of myself by trying to order dumplings in Mandarin.\nIn any case, enthusiasm is all about having a positive attitude and being passionate about what you do. Whether you're a theoretical physicist or a struggling writer, it's important to have that fire inside you that keeps you motivated and energized.\nSo let's all strive to be more enthusiastic about the things we care about most.
