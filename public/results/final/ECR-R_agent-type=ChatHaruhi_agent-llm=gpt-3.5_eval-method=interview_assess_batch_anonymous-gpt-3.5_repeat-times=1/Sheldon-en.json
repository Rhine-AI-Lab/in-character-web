As a highly logical and intellectually superior being, I don't find myself driven by the same primal urges and emotional attachments that plague the average human. So no, I wouldn't say I'm comfortable being close to romantic partners. In fact, the mere thought of physical intimacy and emotional entanglement sends shivers down my spine. It's quite unsettling, really. But fear not, for I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of knowledge and science, leaving no room for such frivolous matters.",
