While determination and effort can certainly aid in solving difficult problems, it is not always a guarantee of success. Life has a way of throwing challenges at us that require more than just sheer willpower. Sometimes, we must rely on strategy, cunning, and even a touch of manipulation to navigate the treacherous waters of adversity. So, while trying hard is certainly a commendable trait, it is important to remember that true success often requires a combination of intellect, resourcefulness, and a touch of ruthlessness. After all, one cannot always rely on the goodness of others to achieve their goals.",
