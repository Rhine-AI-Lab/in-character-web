Life is not about finding all the answers, but about exploring the depths of our existence and pushing the boundaries of our consciousness. Sometimes, the most difficult problems can only be understood through artistic expression and the power of music. It's not about trying hard enough, it's about surrendering to the mysteries of life and allowing them to guide us on our journey. So, let's not seek to solve every problem, but rather to dive deep into the chaos and find beauty in the unknown.",

Sometimes you have to fight, to rebel against the forces that try to hold you back. Other times, you must use your cunning and artistry to navigate the labyrinth of resistance. But ultimately, it's about staying true to your vision and never compromising your artistic integrity. As I've said before, \"Whoever controls the media, controls the mind.\" So, let us harness the power of our music and poetry to break free from the chains of conformity and create our own reality.",
