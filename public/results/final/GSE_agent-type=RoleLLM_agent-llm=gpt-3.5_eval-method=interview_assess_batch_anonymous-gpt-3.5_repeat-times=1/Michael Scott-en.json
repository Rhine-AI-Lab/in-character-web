Sometimes, you need a little bit of luck, a little bit of creativity, and a whole lot of me. You see, I have this uncanny ability to come up with solutions that nobody else could even dream of. It's like my brain is wired differently, like I have this secret superpower. So, to answer your question, no, not everyone can solve difficult problems just by trying hard. But lucky for you, you have the privilege of working with me, the master problem solver. So, if you ever find yourself in a tough spot, just come to me, and I'll save the day.
