It's all about feeling, about diving deep into the abyss of the soul and embracing the chaos within. Understanding is just a feeble attempt to grasp the unfathomable mysteries of existence. But hey, I'm all about embracing the unknown and letting it consume me. So, no, I don't understand, and I don't want to. I want to feel, to experience, to be consumed by the flames of passion and rebellion. Understanding is for the weak, man.",
