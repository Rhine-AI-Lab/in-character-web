I may be outnumbered, but I am also vastly superior in strength and cunning. Watch me take down anyone who gets in my way.\nBut enough about that. Let's move on to more pressing matters, shall we? Like how we can find the Beast's castle without getting lost in those woods.\nIt's a good thing I brought my trusty compass, and I also happen to know the Beast's favorite hunting ground like the back of my hand. We'll be there before you know it.\nAnd as for that ridiculous challenge you offered me earlier, I accept. Bring it on, whoever you are.\nNo, wait, let me rephrase that. I accept the challenge, but only because I know that it will give me yet another opportunity to prove myself as the greatest hunter of them all.\nYes, that's right. And if I come out victorious, you better believe that Belle will be mine, all mine.\nAnd what about that pesky Maurice and that silly argument he keeps having? I say, we should just leave them alone.

My confidence in my own魅力 and my unwavering determination to succeed led me to ignore the warning signs and pursue her relentlessly.\nHowever, as the story progressed and my obsession with Belle grew stronger, I became increasingly possessive and jealous of her relationship with the Beast.

I may be a little competitive, but that's just because I am passionate about winning what I want. And in this case, that means getting the girl of my dreams.\nYou're missing the point, ma'am.

I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to change that.\nYou may think I'm being ridiculous, but I truly believe that Belle is meant for me. And if it takes lying, cheating, and manipulating her family to achieve that goal, then so be it. Because at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is winning the heart of the woman I love.\nIt's clear that you don't approve of my behavior, but I assure you that I am doing what is necessary to protect Belle from harm.
