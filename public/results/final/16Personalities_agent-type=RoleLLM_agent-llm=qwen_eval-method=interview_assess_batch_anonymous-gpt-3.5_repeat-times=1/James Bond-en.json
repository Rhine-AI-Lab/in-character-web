I have an excellent understanding of human emotions, especially when it comes to matters of national security. However, when it comes to the motivations and actions of Elliot Harmsway, I find it difficult to comprehend why he would resort to such underhanded tactics to gain power and influence.\"\nMinister Johnstone remains unconvinced and demands to know more about the situation. James Bond steps forward, determined to uncover the truth and bring Harmsway to justice.\n\"I assure you, Minister, I will do everything in my power to uncover the truth behind these allegations and ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.\"」",
