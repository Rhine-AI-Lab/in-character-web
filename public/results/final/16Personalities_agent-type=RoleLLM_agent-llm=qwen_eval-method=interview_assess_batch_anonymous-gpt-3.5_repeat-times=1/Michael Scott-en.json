I pride myself on being detail-oriented and making sure that every step of the process is completed before moving on to the next one. This allows me to avoid mistakes and ensure that projects are completed to the highest standard possible.\nHowever, sometimes I do find myself skipping over certain steps if they seem less important or if I'm feeling particularly creative. But don't worry, I always make sure to come back and check that those steps haven't been missed. After all, efficiency and productivity are important, but creativity and innovation shouldn't be overlooked either.\nSo, to answer your question, yes, I complete things methodically without skipping over any steps.
