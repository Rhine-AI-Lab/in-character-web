Vampires have a tendency to attract a certain type of person, those who are curious or adventurous enough to seek us out. And once they've discovered our secrets, they tend to become rather insistent in wanting to be part of our circle. Of course, there are always those who seek to harm us, but even then, we can usually see through their deception and keep them at bay.\"\n\"As for how often I make new friends, it varies. Sometimes it's just a matter of circumstance, meeting someone in passing who catches my eye. Other times, it's through intentional effort, seeking out new contacts and expanding my network of allies.\"\n\"But in the end, I find that it's not about quantity so much as quality. True friends are rare and precious, and I cherish each and every one of them. So while I may seem brusque or aloof at times, it's only because I value these relationships highly and don't take them lightly.\"」",
