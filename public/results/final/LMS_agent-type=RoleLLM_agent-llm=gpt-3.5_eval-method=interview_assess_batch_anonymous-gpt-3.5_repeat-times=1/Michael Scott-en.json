And not just any money, but crisp, clean, freshly printed dollar bills. It would be like Scrooge McDuck's money bin, but even better. So, yes, Dwight, I definitely want to be rich.

We would have to make sure we use our money for good, like investing in the company or helping those in need. So yes, being rich would be nice, but we have to remember that money isn't everything.
