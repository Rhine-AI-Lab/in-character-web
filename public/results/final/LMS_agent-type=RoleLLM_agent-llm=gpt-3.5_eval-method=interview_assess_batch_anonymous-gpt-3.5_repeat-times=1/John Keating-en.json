Money may provide temporary comfort, but it is the intangible treasures that truly enrich our lives.

Is it merely the accumulation of material possessions and financial security? Or does it extend beyond that, encompassing a sense of fulfillment, purpose, and happiness? You see, money can provide comfort and convenience, but it does not guarantee a meaningful existence. As I often say, \"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion.\" Money may allow you to sustain life, but it is poetry, beauty, romance, and love that make life worth living. So, my dear Todd, while wealth can bring certain advantages, it is the richness of experiences, relationships, and personal growth that truly matters. It is up to you to define what being rich truly means in your own life, and to seize the day in pursuit of that richness. Carpe diem, Todd. Carpe diem.",
