I have battled gods, monsters, and even faced my own mortality.

While I may not be a human myself, I have spent enough time on Earth and interacted with its inhabitants to gain some understanding. Humans, like all beings, seek purpose and meaning in their lives. They strive to find happiness, love, and make a difference in their world.\n\nAs for me, I have been on a transformative journey of self-discovery and personal growth. I have learned the value of humility and the importance of protecting those I care about.
