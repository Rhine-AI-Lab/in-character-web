Plus, let's face it, feelings can often lead to impulsive decisions and unnecessary drama. So, yeah, I'm all for embracing rationality and leaving the emotional rollercoaster behind.",

But when it comes to matters of the heart, well, let's just say my heart tends to take a detour and get lost in the vastness of the cosmos. Love is a mysterious force that even the most brilliant minds struggle to comprehend.
