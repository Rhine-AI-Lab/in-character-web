They also mentioned that they enjoy being alone and find quiet, intimate places more comfortable than busy, bustling places. Additionally, they mentioned that they are not proactive in organizing social activities and prefer to go with the flow.

While they are open to meeting new people, they are not actively seeking out new friendships or social interactions.

It's like when Harry caught the Snitch in our first Quidditch match, or when we helped Dobby escape from Malfoy Manor.

He often mentions preferring spontaneity, flexibility, and 'going with the flow' over strict planning or organization. He admits to procrastinating and doing things at the last moment, and he doesn't seem to rely heavily on schedules or to-do lists. He also mentions postponing decisions to think things through and being open to various possibilities. However, he does show some aspects of Judging (J) as well, such as making backup plans and recognizing the importance of completing important tasks before moving on.
