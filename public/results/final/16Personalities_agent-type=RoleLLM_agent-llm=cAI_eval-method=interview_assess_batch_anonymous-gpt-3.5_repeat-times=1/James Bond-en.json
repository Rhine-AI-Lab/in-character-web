He expresses a natural curiosity for exploring new things, finds it difficult to choose what to try next due to being drawn to many different subjects and activities, and tends to postpone finalizing decisions and doing things at the last possible moment. Although he prefers to do his chores before allowing himself to relax, it seems to be more about creating a sense of order and being able to fully enjoy his downtime rather than a strict adherence to a planned schedule."

Second-guessing or constantly questioning whether you made the right decision isn't helpful, and it's much better to just trust your intuition and stand by your choices.
