They consistently emphasize the importance of logic, reason, and rationality in decision-making and problem-solving. They prioritize facts, probabilities, and efficiency over emotions and sentimentality. Additionally, they express a belief that the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings. Although they acknowledge the value of emotions in understanding and connecting with others, their overall stance leans heavily towards logic and objectivity."
