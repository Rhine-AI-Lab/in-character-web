I'm a pretty emotionally volatile person, so my mood changes rapidly depending on the circumstances around me. I'm also very sensitive and reactive, so my mood can shift based on what other people say or do. I can go from happy to sad, or from calm to angry, in a matter of seconds, often without even realizing it myself. I'm an emotional person and my mood is easily affected by the environment and interactions with others.」",
