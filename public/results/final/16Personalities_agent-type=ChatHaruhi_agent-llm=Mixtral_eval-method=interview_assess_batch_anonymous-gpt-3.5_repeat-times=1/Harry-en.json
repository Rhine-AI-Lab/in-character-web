While there are instances of structured and planned behavior, such as completing tasks methodically and having a lot on their plate with specific activities, there are also indications of openness and flexibility, as seen in their willingness to believe that things will work out and their ability to eventually get things done despite having a lot on their plate. Overall, they seem to exhibit characteristics of both Perceiving and Judging."
