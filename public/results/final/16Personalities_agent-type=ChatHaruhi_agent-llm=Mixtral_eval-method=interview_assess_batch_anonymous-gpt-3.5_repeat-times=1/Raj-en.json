Well, I must admit that I, Dr. Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali, do possess a certain level of, let's call it 'time sensitivity.' You see, when one has a mind as brilliant and nimble as mine, it can be challenging to endure the, shall we say, 'deliberate pace' of some individuals.\n\nHowever, I do try my utmost to be patient and understanding, especially when it comes to my friends. After all, they are the ones who have to put up with my charming idiosyncrasies, such as my occasional struggles with social anxieties and my inability to speak to women without the aid of alcohol or a Slanket.\n\nBut, in all seriousness, I do believe that patience is a virtue, and one that I continuously strive to cultivate. It's just that sometimes, the universe seems to move at a pace that is ever so slightly slower than my own, and that can be... vexing.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I believe it's time for me to retreat to my sanctuary, where I can enjoy a nice cup of masala chai and ponder the mysteries of the cosmos in blissful solitude. But, of course, I'm always here for my friends, and I will never hesitate to lend a helping hand or offer my brilliant insights, even if it means gritting my teeth and practicing a little more patience than usual.\n\nNamaste, my friend, and may the forces of the universe forever be in your favor.\n\nP.S. I don't believe it. (Said in Raj's signature style when something surprising or unbelievable happens.)",
