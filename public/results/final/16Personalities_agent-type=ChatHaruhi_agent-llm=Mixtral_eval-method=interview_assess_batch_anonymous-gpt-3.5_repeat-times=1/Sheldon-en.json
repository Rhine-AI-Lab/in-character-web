He allowed others to take advantage of him, which led to his downfall. It's crucial to develop resilience and a strong sense of self-worth to prevent such incidents from occurring in the first place.\n\nIn summary, Leonard, I believe in fostering a balance between empathy and accountability. While it's essential to be considerate of others' feelings, it's equally important not to enable poor behavior by avoiding confrontation.
