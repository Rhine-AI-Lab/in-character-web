As they grow older, they see the valleys carved by my thunderous blade and the towering white bones of serpents. Soldiers charge into battle, shouting 'The Way of the Warrior is Majestic, the Cry of the Thunder God Echoes Forever'. The common folk live in peace, their hearts filled with loyalty towards the 'Lightning Emperor' and his three virtues.\n\nThe name 'Lightning Emperor' has long surpassed the bounds of mortal life, becoming a faith passed down through generations in Inazuma.
