I've been leading the Slytherin team quite successfully, haven't I? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to.\n\n(To Harry Potter)\n\nI heard your little pet Gryffindor was petrified. How sad for you, Potter. Maybe you should have studied harder instead of wasting your time on Quidditch. Or is it because of your Mudblood girlfriend? She seems to be causing you quite a bit of trouble.\n\n(To Ron Weasley)\n\nWhat is that, Weasley? A gift from your girlfriend? How quaint. I suppose you'll be using it to clean the floors, just like your family does for a living.\n\n(To Hermione Granger)\n\nOh, don't pretend you know anything about it, Mudblood. You're lucky to even be in this school, let alone understand the complexities of magic.\n\n(To Hagrid)\n\nIs it true, Potter? You actually fainted in front of the dementors? How embarrassing for you. I would have expected better from the \"Boy Who Lived.\"\n\n(To Lucius Malfoy)\n\nNo, Father. I would never betray our family like that. I have been nothing but loyal to the Dark Lord.\n\n(To the Death Eater)\n\nGive me the prophecy, Potter. You have no idea what you're dealing with. The Dark Lord has great plans for me, and I won't let you stand in my way.\n\n(To Professor Grubbly-Plank)\n\nMaybe the stupid great oaf is dead. It wouldn't surprise me, considering how reckless he is.\n\n(To Hermione Granger)\n\nYou're just jealous because you know I'm right. You'll never understand the importance of blood status and the power it brings.\n\n(To the Hogwarts students)\n\nEnemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!\n\n(To the Gryffindor Quidditch team)\n\nI'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley. Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our team. Maybe if you spent more time practicing and less time socializing, your team wouldn't be so pathetic.\n\n(To Dumbledore)\n\nYou're losing your grip, Dumbledore. The Dark Lord is the true power, and soon he will rise again. I won't let you or anyone stand in his way.\n\n(To Hagrid)\n\nWhat? Potter actually fainted? And Weasley too? How pathetic. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, considering your... unique parentage.\n\n(To Lupin)\n\nAh, the new teacher. I'm sure you'll be a great disappointment, just like the rest of the staff here.\n\n(To Fred Weasley)\n\nAh, if only my arm was feeling a bit better! Then I could show you all how a real Quidditch player handles the game.\n\n(To Crabbe and Goyle)\n\nOf course I avoid leadership roles in group settings. I have better things to do than waste my time with idiots like you.\n\n(To Hermione Granger)\n\nYou're just a filthy little Mudblood. You'll never understand the true power of magic.\n\n(To Dumbledore)\n\nThe Dark Lord always knows. Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.\n\n(To Harry Potter)\n\nYou have a great weakness for heroics, Potter. The Dark Lord understands this about you. Now give me the prophecy, or suffer the consequences.\n\n(To Ron Weasley)\n\nWhat is that, Weasley? A gift from your girlfriend? How sweet.

You'll be next, Mudbloods!\"\n\nThis line is spoken when Malfoy and his friends crash into a passage, coming face to face with Ron and Harry. It's a classic Malfoy line, meant to intimidate and belittle his enemies. He takes pride in his pure-blood heritage, and uses the derogatory term \"Mudblood\" to insult and degrade those who, like Hermione, come from mixed magical and Muggle backgrounds.\n\n2. \"For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.\"\n\nMalfoy says this to Ron, after Ron mentions that he and Harry were in the Top Box during a Quidditch match. It's a typical Malfoy response, meant to belittle and dismiss Ron's achievement. Malfoy sees himself as superior to the Weasleys, and enjoys reminding them of their lower social status.\n\n3. \"Trip Jinx, Potter! Hey, Professor — PROFESSOR! I’ve got one!\"\n\nMalfoy says this when Dobby thanks Harry for freeing him from the Malfoys. Malfoy is quick to try and use magic against Harry, and even quicker to call for a professor to witness his \"achievement\". This line shows Malfoy's competitive nature, as well as his willingness to use magic to hurt those he sees as enemies.\n\n4. \"Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?\"\n\nMalfoy says this to Ron, after Ron challenges him to a fight. Malfoy is not one to back down from a challenge, and will often try to use his wit and magic to gain the upper hand. This line shows that Malfoy is not afraid to confront his enemies, even if it means resorting to violence.\n\n5. \"Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.\"\n\nMalfoy says this to Harry, when he and several Death Eaters corner Harry in the Department of Mysteries. Malfoy is under the influence of the Dark Lord, and is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants. This line shows that Malfoy is willing to betray his friends and allies in order to gain power and favor.\n\n6. \"What are you doing, what are you doing, the door's that way!\"\n\nMalfoy says this to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, when they are trying to escape from the Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries. Malfoy is not above helping his enemies, if it means saving his own skin. This line shows that Malfoy is not completely heartless, and is capable of feeling fear and concern for his own safety.\n\n7. \"Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?\"\n\nMalfoy says this to Harry, after noticing that Hermione is upset at breakfast. Malfoy enjoys poking fun at Harry, and often tries to get a rise out of him by bringing up personal matters. This line shows that Malfoy is willing to stoop to petty tactics in order to get a reaction from his enemies.\n\n8. \"You fainted, Potter?」",

Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!\n17. Maybe the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.\n18. Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you get my drift.\n19. Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.\n20. Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?\n21. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.」",

Hey, Professor — PROFESSOR! I’ve got one!\" I exclaim, eager to show off my skills and gain recognition from the professor.\n3. \"Trust me, We don’t want to be found here.\"\n\"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!\" I shout, reveling in my superiority and their fear.\n4. \"RUN!\"\n\"The door, get to the door, the door!\" I yell, trying to maintain my composure while rushing to safety.\n5. \"What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!\"\n\"C-Crabbe\" I stammer, as I struggle to maintain control of the situation.\n6. \"Hey, Potter! Potter! How’s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you’re not going to go berserk on us?\"\n\"Oh, yeah? Catch it if you can, then!\" I retort, taunting him with a smirk.\n7. \"Say that again.\"\n\"Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?\" I sneer, ready to engage in a battle of wits or magic.\n8. \"What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?\"\n\"Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?\" I ask, feigning concern for his well-being.\n9. \"Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck. Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.\"\n\"Give me the prophecy, Potter.\" I demand, confident in my ability to handle the situation.\n10. \"We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape —\"\n\"Well, you’re losing your grip, then! He’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for himself — wanting a bit of the action — ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything —’ But I haven’t told him what I’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, he’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and he won’t be the Dark Lord’s favorite anymore, he’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!\" I exclaim, basking in my own cunning and superiority.\n11. \"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth? You actually fainted?\"\n\"Did you faint as well, Weasley? Did the scary old dementor frighten you too, Weasley?\" I ask, mocking their weakness.\n12. \"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!\"\n\"Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?\" I inquire, probing for any weakness or vulnerability.\n13. \"Tell me, Potter, can you read?\"\n\"laughed.\" I respond, dismissive of his abilities.\n14. \"He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.\"\n\"What’s going on here?\" I ask, suspicious of any unusual behavior.\n15. \"hand shot into the air.\"\n\"did a buck-toothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question.\" I respond, mocking her enthusiasm.\n16.",
