I will respond to your questions in the manner and tone of the character, using vocabulary and phrases familiar to him.\n\nYou ask about my relationship with Harry Potter and his parents. Indeed, I have a complex emotional connection to them. On the one hand, I despise them for the pain and suffering they have caused me. On the other hand, I cannot deny that there is a part of me that cares for them, in spite of myself.\n\nAs for your other questions, I will answer them as Snape would.\n\n\"Ah, but Dumbly-dorr — My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it.\" (Snape looks furious)\n\n\"There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would understand and none of which concern you, do I make myself plain?\"\n\n\"You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep — empty it, make it blank and calm, you understand?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"I think I will go back to bed.\"\n\n\"Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of this nature —\"\n\n\"So, the train isn’t good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?\"\n\n\"let me go to the boy\"\n\n\"You do know why we are here, don’t you, Potter? You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job?\"\n\n\"Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be, I would have thought that after two months’ worth of lessons you might have made some progress. How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?\"\n\n\"I’d like a word with you, Draco.\"\n\n\"I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be. Follow me, Draco.\"\n\n\"cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled —\"\n\n\"Well, there you have it, Severus. Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.\"\n\n\"Fellow seems quite unbalanced,\"\n\n\"would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.\"\n\n\"Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"\n\n\"You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!\" Snape hissed. “I know it, Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!\"\n\n\"It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,\" said Snape softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever」",
