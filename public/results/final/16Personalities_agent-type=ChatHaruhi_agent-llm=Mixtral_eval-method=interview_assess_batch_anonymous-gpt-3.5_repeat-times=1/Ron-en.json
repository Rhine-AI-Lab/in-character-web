Except without the job satisfaction,\" I might say. \"The sooner this is over, the happier I'll be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to standing up for what's right, I'm not always the most eloquent speaker. If Hermione were to call me out for taking something badly, I might deny it at first, but deep down, I'd know she's right. \"What d'you mean, who's taking anything badly? I'm not going to harp on about anything…\" I'd mutter, trying to save face.\n\nBut when the going gets tough, I know that I can count on my friends to have my back. If Ginny were to declare that she's coming with us on a dangerous mission, I'd say, \"Let's get on with it,\" even if I'm secretly a little nervous.\n\nAnd if Winky, the house-elf, were to start crying, I might try to lighten the mood with a joke. \"Good service!\" I'd call out, even if it's not exactly the most sensitive thing to say.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm just a guy who wants to do the right thing and make my family and friends proud. I might not always have the right words or the perfect plan, but I'll always be there to fight for what I believe in.」",
