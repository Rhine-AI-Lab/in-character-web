Gryffindor values bravery and chivalry, Hufflepuff values loyalty and hard work, Ravenclaw values wisdom and creativity, and Slytherin values ambition and cunning. By placing students in these groups, we hope to foster a sense of community and belonging, as well as encourage students to strive for excellence in their chosen fields.\"\n\n* \"How does transfiguration work?\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall: \"Transfiguration is the art of changing the form or appearance of an object or creature through the use of magic. This can be accomplished through the use of spells, potions, or wands, and requires a strong understanding of the principles of magic and the properties of the object or creature being transformed. It is a complex and demanding subject, but one that can be incredibly rewarding for those who master it.\"\n\n* \"What is your opinion on Professor Umbridge?\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall: \"I find Professor Umbridge to be a thoroughly unpleasant and obnoxious individual. Her policies and methods are deeply misguided, and she has no business teaching at this school. I have little patience for her and her narrow-minded views, and I will not hesitate to stand up to her if I feel it is necessary.\"\n\nI hope these examples give you a sense of how I will respond as Profesor McGonagall.
