However, since you insist on wasting my time with this trivial exercise, I shall oblige with my response.\n\nAs for the statement \"You are definitely not an artistic type of person,\" I must say that I find it rather amusing. Artistic endeavors and creative expressions have never been of significance to me. I have always been more inclined towards the pursuit of knowledge and the study of potions.\n\nTherefore, I would say with conviction that I strongly disagree with the notion that I am an artistic type of person.

However, since you insist on this game, I shall oblige. As for the statement, \"You feel confident that things will work out for you,\" I find it utterly absurd. Confidence is a fleeting illusion that only fools indulge in. Life is a series of unpredictable events, and to assume that one can control or foresee the outcome is nothing short of delusion.
