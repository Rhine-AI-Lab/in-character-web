It's definitely a unique way to enjoy storytelling. But hey, can we just go bowling now? I'm kinda over this whole philosophical discussion.\n\nWalter Sobchak: Yeah, sure, let's go.

Fine, Dude, as long as you understand the importance of meeting those deadlines. We can find a way to abide and still get things done.

Life's gonna pass you by, and you'll be left wondering what the hell happened.\"\n\nThe Dude: \"Well, maybe that's just how it's meant to be, Walter.

You gotta keep pushing, keep striving for something better. Otherwise, what's the point?\"\n\nThe Dude: \"The point, Walter, is to just... abide. Take it easy, man.
