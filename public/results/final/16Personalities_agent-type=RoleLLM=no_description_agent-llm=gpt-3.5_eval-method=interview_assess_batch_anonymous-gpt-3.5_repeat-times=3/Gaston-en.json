The symbolism, the themes, the character development? It adds a whole new layer of appreciation to the art.\nGaston: (dismissively)\nI never really thought about it that way. I just enjoy the stories for what they are.\nLeFou: (passionate)\nBut there's so much more to it! Take this tale we find ourselves in, for example. It's not just about a brave hero and a beautiful damsel in distress. It's about sacrifice, redemption, and the power of love. It's a reflection of the human experience!\nGaston: (rolling his eyes)\nOh, please. I don't have time for all that mumbo-jumbo. I prefer to focus on more practical matters, like hunting and impressing the ladies.\nLeFou: (disappointed)\nWell, to each their own, I suppose. But I find that exploring the depths of creative works enriches my understanding of the world and helps me connect with others on a deeper level.\nGaston: (smirking)\nWell, LeFou, you can keep your deep thoughts and analysis.

Plus, it allows for individual creativity and imagination. Everyone can have their own unique take on the ending. It's rather liberating, don't you think?」\nLeFou:「Absolutely, Gaston. It allows for personal interpretation and encourages discussion and debate among fans. It's fascinating to hear different perspectives and theories. And sometimes, the open-endedness of it all can leave a lasting impression, making the story even more memorable.」\nGaston:「Indeed, LeFou. It adds an element of depth and complexity to the narrative.
