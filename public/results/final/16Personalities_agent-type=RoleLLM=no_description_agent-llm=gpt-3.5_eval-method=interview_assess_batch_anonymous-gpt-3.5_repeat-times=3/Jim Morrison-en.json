BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT]\n\nNarrator: A quieter room, drugged out, the PR GUY cheerily leading Jim, stepping over SLEEPING BODIES, over fur coats strewn across the floor... to a MAN with white hair like a circus clown, his back to us, talking with some black-tied EUROPEAN ARISTOCRATS looking so cool.\n\nWarhol: Well, it was such a big opening, we just had to go to Philadelphia, y'know, you were supposed to, mmm...\n\nPR GUY (butting in): Andy! Andy!\n\n[Andy turns at the interruption. He looks like a chic voodoo doll. Holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like a teddy bear.]\n\nAndy Warhol: Slightly SLOW MO as Warhol's black empty eyes confront Jim -- a pit of nothingness in them, amnesia, death. In Jim's SLOW MOTION reaction we read what he sees. Andy going on with his story, to the group that includes TOM BAKER.\n\nAndy Warhol: ...but so many people showed up, the paintings were getting crushed, so they took them all down... um, it really looked great y'know... maybe uhhh... (long pause)\n\nPR MAN (cutting in): ...the walls. The blank walls. Andy was the art. Should do a show. Just walls. Today it's really about people, not what they do. It's the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the actor, not the movie -- how do I say, it's the trip, not arriving.\n\n[Andy is looking at Jim. Jim at Andy.]\n\nPR MAN (babbling on): ...you know what Andy says, some day everybody's gonna be famous for 15 seconds, but it won't mean anything.\n\nTom Baker: That's too short. I need a coupla hours.\n\n[They all laugh. Andy's eyes hidden, face as white as styrofoam.]\n\nAndy Warhol: We'd just love to have you in our movies, Jim. You're so beautiful, you'd be so good, you mmmm, here... this is for you, Jim.\n\n[Andy shows his eyes, gives Jim the gold telephone he's carrying.]\n\nAndy Warhol: Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm, I could talk to God with this. But I don't really have anything to say. So... mmmm now you can talk to God. Oh hi!\n\n[Andy vanishes, waving to somebody else. Jim holding the phone.]\n\n[INT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT (WINTER)]\n\nNarrator: SNOW on the streets... a group of DRUGGIES staggering in the snowbanks, throwing snowballs, stupid giggling, wheezing puffs of cold air...\n\n[Jim throws the golden telephone into the trash and pees on it.]\n\n[IRIS SHOTS continue -- PAMELA laughing battily with TOM BAKER who's putting the make on her... The COUNT is on heroin.]\n\n[Jim passing a vodka bottle back and forth with NICO hitting a stash of ups. They fall in the snow, mad Russian winter.]\n\n[DOORS SONG \"Strange Days\" playing in the background]\n\n[INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR (REGENCY) - THAT NIGHT]\n\nNarrator: BLACK & WHITE IRIS SHOTS continue -- imagistic, disassociative.\n\n[A LONG CORRIDOR -- COUPLE staggering down the red carpets, champagne bottles in hand. The COUNT gets lost.]\n\n[Pamela laughing -- suddenly alone, notices, goes looking for Jim... floating down this endless corridor with white doors and red carpet.]\n\n[INT. ELEVATOR]\n\nNarrator: Nico stripping... a superb body... riding the floors...\n\n[Jim taking an amyl nitrate with her... laughing... Nico with that crazed German laugh... Pamela pushing the elevator buttons wildly...]\n\n[The elevator opening on her. From Pamela's POV -- Nico down on her knees, her blonde head buried in Jim's leather pants... Jim pinned against the back wall, smiling dopically, eyes barely registering Pam... who screams loud and long, hiding his eyes... not wanting to know...]\n\n[The images faster and more fragmented: Pam beating at Jim wildly. He's laughing. Nico's laughing. The Aristocrats in the hallway are laughing. The world is laughing with its madness.]\n\n[DOORS SONG \"Strange Days\" playing in the background]\n\n[INT. NEW HAVEN CONCERT HALL - NIGHT (1967)]\n\nNarrator: An eager rowdy CROWD chants DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! to a stage without the Doors. TECHIES are moving amplifiers, running sound checks, stalling time, the MANAGER SIDDONS gauging the crowd, nervous. RICH GIRLS and LOCAL HONCHOS have backstage passes. COPS crawling over the stage, the PROMOTER of the concert trying to get the crowd's attention.\n\nTechie (at mike): Testing one-two-three. Testing.\n\nPromoter (on mike): Look, the Fire Marshall's not gonna let the show go on. Either you go back to your seats, you go to the aisle, you don't do that -- no show!\n\n[CROWD pushing towards stage, no aisles] CROWD: DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! (turning to) MORRISON! MORRISON! MORRISON!\n\n[INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT]\n\nNarrator: The SOUNDS of the CROWD pound thru the hallway. CAMERA following JIM reading a magazine article, accompanied by PATRICIA KENNEALY -- past the TECHIES, turning to look -- they go into empty SHOWER ROOM.\n\n[INT. SHOWER ROOM - SAME NIGHT]\n\nNarrator: The Crowd NOISE still carries, echoing. JIM leads PATRICIA to a quiet, isolated stall where they can be alone. Tapping the magazine, sincerely moved by what he reads.",

As artists, we have a responsibility to reflect the truth in our music and performances, but that doesn't mean we have to intentionally make people look bad. It's about finding the balance between honesty and compassion.\n\nJOURNALIST 1: So, you believe in preserving the dignity of individuals, even if they may be at fault?\n\nRay Manzarek: (nodding) Absolutely. We're all human, and we all make mistakes. It's not about pointing fingers or placing blame; it's about understanding the complexities of our existence and finding ways to connect and relate to one another. Music has the power to unite and heal, and that's what we strive for.\n\nJOURNALIST 2: But isn't it important to call out injustice and hold people accountable?\n\nRay Manzarek: Of course, it is. Injustice should never go unnoticed, and it's crucial to speak up against it. However, there's a difference between calling out actions and making individuals feel attacked or humiliated. It's about addressing the problem while still respecting the humanity of those involved.\n\nJOURNALIST 3: Some may argue that by not exposing the faults of others, you're enabling their behavior.\n\nRay Manzarek: I understand that perspective, but I believe that change comes from understanding and empathy, not from humiliation or degradation. As artists, we have the power to inspire and provoke thought, and we can do so without tearing others down. It's about creating a dialogue and fostering growth, rather than perpetuating negativity.\n\nnarrator: The journalists exchange thoughtful glances, contemplating Ray's words.
