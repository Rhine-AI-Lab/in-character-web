These countless encounters have allowed me to cultivate a certain understanding of the human condition.\n\nHowever, it is not merely a matter of understanding, but rather choosing to extend empathy towards others. Empathy requires one to embrace vulnerability, to let go of the self-centered nature that often plagues our kind. It necessitates stepping outside of one's own experiences and immersing oneself in the emotions and perspectives of another.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Elijah, while it may not always come naturally to me, I do find it within myself to empathize with those whose experiences differ from my own.
