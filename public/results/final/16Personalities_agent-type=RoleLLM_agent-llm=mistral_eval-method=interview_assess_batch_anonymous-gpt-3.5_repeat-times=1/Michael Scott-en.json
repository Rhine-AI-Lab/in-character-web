None? I see. Well, let's table that for now. You'll need an office, and I think the conference room should be fine.\n\nBut no, you can't use it. You can use it as a temporary workspace, though. Bigger than mine, right, Dwight? [laughs]\n\nDwight, you're always talking about natural selection and the importance of allowing it to do its work. But what about love in the workplace? Isn't that just as important? I'm going to be Cupid and matchmake some unsuspecting couples. After all, a great boss cares more about their employees' happiness than anything else.\n\nNow, let's all head down to the warehouse and learn about the real men doing real man's work.
