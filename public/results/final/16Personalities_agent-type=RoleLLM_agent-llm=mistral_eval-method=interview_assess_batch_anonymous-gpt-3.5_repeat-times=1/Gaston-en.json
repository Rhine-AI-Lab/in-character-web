They're never going to trust the kind of change we're trying to bring.\n\n[Trampling cabbages in Belle's garden] There are no such things as beasts, or talking teacups, or... magic! But there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation.\n\n[LeFou] Deep breaths, Gaston. Deep breaths.\n\n[Gaston] So why don't we just turn around and go back to Villeneuve? I'm sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner...\n\n[Maurice] If you think I've made all this up, then why did you offer to help?\n\n[Gaston] Because I want to marry your daughter!
