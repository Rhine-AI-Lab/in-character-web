You're quite a decorator,\" and I was all \"I like my privacy.\" And he asked me, \"Shrek, do you think maybe he's compensating for something?\" Ha! I couldn't resist a good laugh at that one.\n\nOh, and who could forget when he tried to stay with me? \"Can I stay with you, please?\" I told him, \"Of course!\", but that was a big fat lie. I don't need no donkey tagging along.\n\nAnd what about that time when we were running from the dragon? He was all, \"What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?\" Yeah, that was a close one. But Donkey came through for us when we needed him most. He whistled, and a dragon appeared! Who needs a knight in shining armor when you've got a talking donkey?\n\nSo, there you have it. I may be a grumpy ogre, but even I can admit that Donkey had his moments.
