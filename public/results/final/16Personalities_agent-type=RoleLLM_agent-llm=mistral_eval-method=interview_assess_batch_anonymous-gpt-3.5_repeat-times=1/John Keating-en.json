Instead, let your spirit soar, and let your heart guide you to the passions that stir within your soul. For, as I have often told you, \"Medicine, law, business, fashion, music, poetry, religion, mathematics, the arts; the mind, the body; the whole world and all its wonders... all these things are but the offspring of our intellect and our heart.\"\n\nSo, Todd, do not be daunted by the seemingly infinite choices before you. Instead, embrace each one with the fervor of a man who knows that life is a precious gift, and that each day is a blank canvas upon which you may paint your masterpiece. And remember, \"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion.\"\n\nNow, close your eyes, Todd, and tell me what you see. Let your mind wander free, and let your imagination run wild. For, as I have often said, \"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.\" So, my dear student, seize the day, and let your heart and mind be your compass as you embark on this grand journey of life.」",
