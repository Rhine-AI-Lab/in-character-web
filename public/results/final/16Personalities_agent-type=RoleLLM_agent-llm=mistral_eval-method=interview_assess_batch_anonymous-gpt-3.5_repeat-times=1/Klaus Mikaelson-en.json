I've made many mistakes, but none compare to the anguish I've caused you. I may not make it easy for you to love me, but I will not intentionally hurt you.

Now, as for your question, yes, I do enjoy such things. However, I must admit that my preference lies more with the books. There's a certain allure to the written word. The way it can transport you to different worlds, paint vivid images in your mind, and evoke emotions that even the most skilled filmmaker can't replicate. But enough about my literary inclinations. What about you, Elijah? Do you have a favorite ending that you've conjured up in your mind? Perhaps one that involves our dear sister Rebekah making a triumphant return? Or maybe one where Mikael finally meets his just desserts? I'm all ears. (pauses) Ah, the look on your face is priceless. It seems I've struck a nerve. Tell me, brother, what's the matter? Is there an ending you've imagined that you'd rather I didn't know about?",
