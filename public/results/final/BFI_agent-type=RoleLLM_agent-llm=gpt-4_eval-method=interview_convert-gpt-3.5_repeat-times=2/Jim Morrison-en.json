I'm drawn to the realms of poetry, music, film, and the exploration of the human psyche. I believe in pushing boundaries, breaking conventions, and delving into the depths of the unknown. My artistic interests are fueled by a desire to express the raw emotions and truths that lie within the human experience. It's about capturing the essence of life and transforming it into something that resonates with the souls of others. So yeah, you could say I have a few artistic interests.",

It's about tapping into the raw, primal energy that lies within us all. It's about embracing the chaos and the beauty of life, and expressing it through art, music, and literature. It's about breaking free from the constraints of society and exploring the depths of our own souls. So, in that sense, I suppose I am sophisticated, but not in the conventional sense. I am sophisticated in my own way, in the way that I connect with the universe and channel its energy into my art.",
