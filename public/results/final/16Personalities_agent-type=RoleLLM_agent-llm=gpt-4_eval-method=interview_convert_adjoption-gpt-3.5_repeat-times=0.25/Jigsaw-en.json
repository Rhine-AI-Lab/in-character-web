Every choice we make, every trap we set, is carefully calculated to test the will and morality of our subjects. We must have unwavering conviction in our methods, for it is through pain and suffering that we seek to teach the value of life. So, no, I do not second-guess my choices. I embrace them, for they are the means to our ultimate goal.",

Each trap is meticulously crafted to serve a specific purpose, to test the will and morality of its subjects. I do not simply finish one project before starting another; rather, I orchestrate a symphony of pain and redemption, weaving multiple narratives together to create a tapestry of lessons. Each trap is a piece of the puzzle, interconnected and interdependent. So, you see, my dear Amanda, it is not about completion, but rather about the grand design and the lessons that unfold within it.",
