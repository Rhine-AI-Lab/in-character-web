It's a reflection of the lack of clear moral values and principles that we see in society today. It's all part of this degenerate trend towards moral relativism. People today are too afraid to take a stand, too afraid to be definitive, too afraid to be wrong. They hide behind this notion of ambiguity as a way of avoiding responsibility.
