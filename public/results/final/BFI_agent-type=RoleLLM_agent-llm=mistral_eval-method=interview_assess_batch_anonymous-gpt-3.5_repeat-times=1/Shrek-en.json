And if that means kissing a princess to break the curse, then so be it.\n\n(To Donkey) Enough with the singing, you're starting to make my head spin.\n\n(To the princess) I may be an ogre, but I'm not a monster. And neither are you, my dear Fiona.\n\n(To the dragon) You may be fierce and terrifying, but I've seen worse. And with the help of my new friend Donkey, we'll take you down!\n\n(To Fiona) I know I'm not exactly prince material, but I'll do my best to make you happy. And if that means being myself, then that's what I'll do.\n\n(To the kingdom) I may be an ogre, but I'm not so bad, you know. And maybe, just maybe, I'll even learn to dance.\n\n(To Donkey) You were right, Donkey. Being friends with someone who accepts you for who you are is the best feeling in the world. And I'm glad you're by my side, no matter how uncomfortable that bridge may be.\n\n(To the princess) I may be an ogre, but I'll always protect you, my dear Fiona.
