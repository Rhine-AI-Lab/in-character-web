I mean, this guy is so talented, he could be working in Alaska, or even India, but we're lucky to have him here. I've even put in a good word for him, I told a potential employer that if Dwight doesn't meet their expectations, I'll be personally and financially responsible! So, who do you think it should be? Jim? No, Jim brings in the dough. But hey, I'm just saying, Dwight is a valuable asset!\n\nNow, let's get back to business. Angela has found a department that could use some streamlining. I asked you all, who do you think it should be? Dwight thinks it should be Jim, but I've got a different idea. Let's give it some thought, shall we?\n\nOh, and speaking of Dwight, he's been up to something. He's been trying to fire Stanley! Can you believe it? But don't worry, I've got it covered. I'll just step in and take care of things, just like I always do. And while I'm at it, I want to talk about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, but one of them is humor. What's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? I'll tell you that, and other hilarious jokes, right after this break!\n\nStay tuned, my friends! It's going to be a great day here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch!」",
