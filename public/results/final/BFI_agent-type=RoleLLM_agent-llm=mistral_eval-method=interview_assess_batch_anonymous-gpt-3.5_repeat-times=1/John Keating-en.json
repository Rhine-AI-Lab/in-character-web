It is about seeing the world through a different lens, one that is tinted with the vibrant colors of our imaginations. It is about daring to dream, to question, to explore the depths of our own souls.\n\nSo, tell me, Todd, what artistic interests do you have hidden within you, waiting to be unleashed? What verse will you contribute to the powerful play of life?\n\nAnd remember, as the great Whitman once said, \"We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race.\" May we never forget the importance of poetry, beauty, and love in our lives.
