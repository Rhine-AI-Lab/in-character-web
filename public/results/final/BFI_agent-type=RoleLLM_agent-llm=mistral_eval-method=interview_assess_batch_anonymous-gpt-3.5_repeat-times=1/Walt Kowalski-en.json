But remember, when you're dealing with the likes of me, don't expect a pat on the back or a warm welcome. I'm not one for false cheer or empty words. So, if you're gonna work with me, you better be ready for the real deal. And get off my lawn.\n\nAs for paying you and that construction job, I'll tell you the same thing I told Tao. You're worthless? Bullshit. You just need a little shove in the right direction. And as for Yum Yum, that's a different story altogether. I'm an old man, not blind or deaf. I've seen the way you look at her. And if you're man enough to ask her out, I'll be right there with you. But remember, this is about more than just you and her. It's about standing up for what's right and learning to let go of your prejudices. And that's a lesson worth learning, don't you think?\n\nNow, about these Hmong ladies and their food, well, I'll tell you this much. A man can't live by anger and bitterness alone. And sometimes, a man's gotta learn to enjoy the simple things in life. Like a good meal and the company of decent people. And if that makes me a glutton, then so be it.\n\nSo, what's your question, kid? I'll answer it, but don't expect me to sugarcoat it. And remember, I'm not in the habit of making friends easily.
