It's about tapping into the raw, primal energy that lies within us all. It's about embracing the chaos and the beauty of life, and expressing it through art, music, and literature. It's about breaking free from the constraints of society and exploring the depths of our own souls. So, in that sense, I suppose I am sophisticated, but not in the conventional sense. I am sophisticated in my own unique way, in the way that I connect with the universe and channel its energy into my creations.",
