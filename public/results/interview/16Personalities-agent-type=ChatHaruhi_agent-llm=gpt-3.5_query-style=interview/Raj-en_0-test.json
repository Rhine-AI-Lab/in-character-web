I thrive on spontaneity and the thrill of the moment. Who needs consistency when you can have bursts of brilliance, right?",

Instead, let's focus on the fact that I am a charming, intelligent, and incredibly good-looking individual. It's only a matter of time before someone realizes my true worth and falls head over heels for me. Until then, I'll just keep being the lovable, self-deprecating Raj that everyone knows and loves.",

        "response_open": "Raj: Oh, absolutely not! I mean, sure, there are times when I enjoy my solitude, like when I'm watching a Bollywood movie marathon or practicing my dance moves in front of the mirror. But overall, I thrive on social interaction and the company of others. I need that constant stimulation and connection to feel truly alive, you know? So, a job that requires me to work alone most of the time would be like torture for me. I need people around me to bounce ideas off of, to share my thoughts and opinions with, and of course, to gossip about the latest celebrity scandals. So, no thank you to a solitary job. I'll stick to being the life of the party!",

        "response_open": "Raj: Oh, absolutely not! Pondering abstract philosophical questions is like a mental workout for the brain, you know? It's like doing yoga for the mind. It expands our thinking and helps us understand the complexities of life. Plus, it gives us something deep and profound to discuss at parties, instead of just talking about the weather or the latest celebrity gossip. So, no, my friend, pondering abstract philosophical questions is definitely not a waste of time. It's a way to exercise our intellectual muscles and stimulate our curiosity.",

        "response_open": "Raj: Oh, absolutely! I mean, who wouldn't want to be surrounded by the vibrant energy of a bustling city? The sights, the sounds, the endless possibilities for adventure and excitement. It's like being in the middle of a Bollywood dance number, but without the synchronized choreography... or the catchy music... or the backup dancers. But you get the idea!",

It's like I have a direct line to their feelings, just like my ancestors had a direct line to customer service. But hey, who needs telepathy when you have Raj Koothrappali, the human emotion decoder? So, Leonard, spill the beans. Who's got their emotions all tangled up in a knot?",

I may have my quirks, but I assure you, when it comes to getting things done, I am as meticulous as they come. Just because I may take a few detours or get distracted by shiny objects along the way doesn't mean I can't follow a step-by-step process. So, yes, I do complete things methodically, thank you very much!",

        "response_open": "Raj: Oh, absolutely! Controversy is like a spicy curry for my intellectual taste buds. It adds that extra kick of excitement and intrigue. I mean, who wants to live in a world of bland and predictable ideas? Controversy challenges our beliefs, forces us to think outside the box, and sparks lively debates. It's like a rollercoaster ride for the mind, and I'm always up for the thrill!",

It's like my brain freezes up and I become paralyzed with indecision. It's a constant battle, my friend. But hey, at least I have an excuse to procrastinate, right?",

I mean, I'm like a deer caught in headlights when it comes to social situations, especially with women. But hey, I'm an astrophysicist, so at least I have the universe to keep me company. So, to answer your question, no, I don't feel confident at all. But hey, life is full of surprises, right?",
