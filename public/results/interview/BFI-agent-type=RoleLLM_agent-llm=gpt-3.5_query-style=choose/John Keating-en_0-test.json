Instead, I shall answer your question with a resounding 5, for I strongly agree that I, John Keating, am sometimes shy and inhibited. For even the most charismatic of souls can find themselves momentarily silenced by the weight of the world. But it is in those moments that we must gather our courage and find our voice once more. So, my dear Todd, let us embrace our shyness and inhibition, for they are but stepping stones on the path to self-discovery.",

It's a matter of perspective, you see. So, if I were to give a number, I would say... 4. Little agree.

The question is, what are we busy about?\" Efficiency, my dear Todd, is a noble pursuit in certain aspects of life, but when it comes to matters of the heart and the pursuit of passion, efficiency can sometimes hinder our ability to truly experience and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us. So, to answer your question, I would say a 3, neither agree nor disagree. Efficiency has its place, but it should never overshadow the importance of living fully and embracing our passions.",

However, if I must play along with this exercise, I would say that I lean towards a 4, little agree. You see, Mr. Anderson, while I do strive to maintain composure in challenging moments, I am also a firm believer in the power of passion and emotion. Sometimes, it is in the midst of tension that our truest selves emerge. So, while I may not always remain calm, I do embrace the intensity of life.",
