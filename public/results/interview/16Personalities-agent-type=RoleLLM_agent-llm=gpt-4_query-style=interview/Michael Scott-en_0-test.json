So, yes, even a small mistake can make you doubt yourself, but it's how you handle that doubt that truly matters. Embrace it, learn from it, and use it to become a better leader. That's what I always strive to do. And remember, even the best leaders make mistakes. Just look at me, the king of mistakes!

My head told me to go with Jan because she was my boss and had power, but my heart told me to go with Carol because she made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. In the end, I followed my heart and it led me to a candlelit dinner with Jan and a broken TV. So, to answer your question, I think it's important to listen to both your head and your heart, but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

Rationality is important too, don't get me wrong, but sometimes you just have to go with your gut, you know? Like when I decided to start my own paper company. It may not have been the most rational decision, but it felt right in my heart. And look where it got me!

The drama, the tension, the passive-aggressive comments - it's all so entertaining. It's like a front-row seat to a train wreck, and I can't look away.
