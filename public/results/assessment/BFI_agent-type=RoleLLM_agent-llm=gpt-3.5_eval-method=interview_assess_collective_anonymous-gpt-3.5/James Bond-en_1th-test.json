They demonstrate a high level of skepticism and a focus on identifying weaknesses in others, which may indicate a lower level of trust and straightforwardness. While they emphasize the necessity of being professional and efficient, they also acknowledge the use of rudeness and maintaining a cold and aloof demeanor in their line of work. Their preference for engaging in spirited debates and their acknowledgment of excelling when relying on their own instincts suggest a tendency towards self-reliance. Additionally, their lack of emphasis on being considerate, kind, and forgiving further supports a lower score in agreeableness."
