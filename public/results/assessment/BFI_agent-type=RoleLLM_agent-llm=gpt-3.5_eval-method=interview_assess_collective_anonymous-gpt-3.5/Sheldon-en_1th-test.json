According to a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, individuals who exhibit prosocial behavior, such as kindness and consideration, tend to have more positive social interactions and relationships.

Trust must be earned through consistent and reliable behavior over an extended period of time. It is not something that can be given freely or taken lightly.
