We encourage everyone to think outside the box, or as I like to say, \"Think inside the outside of the box.\" We're not afraid to take risks and try new things. In fact, I once tried to start my own paper company because I believed in the power of ideas. So, Dwight, keep reflecting and playing with those ideas. You never know what brilliant breakthrough you might come up with. Just don't forget to run it by me first, because I'm the idea guy. That's what she said!",
