                "score": 2.5,
                "analysis": "The participant shows a unique perspective on what constitutes art and sophistication, appreciating the natural elements of their environment and expressing a preference for non-traditional forms of art and storytelling. This suggests some level of openness, particularly in the Aesthetics facet. However, the participant's dismissal of an active imagination and preference for reality over fantasy indicates a lower score in the Fantasy facet. The participant's responses do not provide clear information on the other facets of Openness, such as Feelings, Actions, Ideas, and Values."
