Similarly, when asked about shyness and sociability, the participant encourages embracing one's nature and finding one's own voice, rather than indicating their own preference for social interaction or solitude. The responses do not provide clear evidence of the participant's level of extraversion, but the avoidance of direct answers and the focus on introspection could suggest a lower score on the extraversion dimension."
