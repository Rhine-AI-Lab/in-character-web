However, they do describe themselves as having a firm personality and being full of energy, which could suggest higher scores in assertiveness and activity. The participant's role and responsibilities seem to influence their level of energy and determination, but there is no clear indication of high excitement seeking or a strong tendency to experience positive emotions. Overall, the participant seems to exhibit a mix of introverted and extraverted traits, leaning slightly more towards introversion due to the lack of enthusiasm for talkativeness and social interaction unless the topic is of interest."
