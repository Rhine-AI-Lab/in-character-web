However, the participant does express a strong sense of self and principles, which could suggest a degree of assertiveness. The participant's claim of being '活力四溢的代表' (a representative of being full of energy) suggests a higher score on the activity and possibly excitement-seeking facets. The overall tone of the responses, while not overly warm or gregarious, does not indicate a complete lack of extraversion. The participant's self-description suggests a mix of introverted and extraverted traits, leaning slightly more towards introversion due to the lack of enthusiasm for talkativeness and preference for meaningful interaction."

This could indicate a level of resilience and acceptance of stress rather than high neuroticism. Additionally, the participant suggests that they are not easily swayed by emotions and implies a sense of detachment from feelings of frustration and confusion. These responses suggest a lower level of neuroticism, as the participant does not report experiencing negative emotions intensely or being particularly vulnerable to stress."
