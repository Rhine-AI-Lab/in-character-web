They consistently emphasize their attention to detail, reliability, organization, and dedication to task completion. They reject notions of carelessness, disorganization, and laziness, and instead highlight their ambition, drive, and persistence. Despite the somewhat dismissive tone towards efficiency in favor of style, the overall portrayal is one of a person who embodies the traits associated with high conscientiousness, such as competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, and deliberation."
