They also reject the notion of being quiet or inhibited, indicating a preference for expression over silence. Although they do not explicitly identify with being assertive, their description of challenging norms and embodying rebellion suggests a form of social dominance. The participant does not resonate with being shy or reserved, and while they question the value of being sociable in a conventional sense, their overall demeanor is indicative of someone who is engaged and expressive in social contexts. The participant's language is filled with metaphors of energy, enthusiasm, and a desire to connect and impact others, all of which align with high Extraversion."
