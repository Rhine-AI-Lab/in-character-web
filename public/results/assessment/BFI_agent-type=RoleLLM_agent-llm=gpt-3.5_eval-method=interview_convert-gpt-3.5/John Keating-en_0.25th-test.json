Now, assertiveness, on the other hand, is a quality that can be cultivated and developed. It is the ability to confidently express oneself and stand up for one's beliefs. So, my dear Mr. Anderson, whether you possess an assertive personality or not, what truly matters is your willingness to embrace your own voice and have the courage to share it with the world. Seize the day, Mr. Anderson, and let your assertiveness shine through.",

So, I encourage my students to find their own paths, to follow their hearts, and in doing so, they discover a resilience and inner strength that helps them navigate through the challenges that life throws their way.
